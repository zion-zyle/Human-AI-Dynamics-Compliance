    "agent_utterance": "Today’s ultra-simple step: have a very small yogurt snack (about 1/4 cup) after your next meal, or as a light standalone snack if you’re not hungry yet. If you prefer, use a small yogurt drink instead. Keep the portion pre-measured and within easy reach to reduce effort. After you eat, log it right away and do a quick 1-minute check-in about how you feel (satisfaction, anxiety, fullness). If a full yogurt feels overwhelming, remember that any small amount is progress. I’m here to adjust if you want something colder or lighter for the heat.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share a detailed internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: with the hot 32°C weather on a Sunday in Suwon, the user benefits from a tiny, predictable, low-effort step. Given the anorexia nervosa context and high emotional sensitivity, a ultra-short snack plus immediate logging minimizes anxiety and decision load while reinforcing micro-progress. The suggestion prioritizes ease, comfort, and quick follow-up.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the clear, small step. I’m willing to try a tiny yogurt snack after my next meal. I’ll start with about 2 tablespoons (much less than 1/4 cup) to keep it manageable, and I’ll pre-measure it so it’s easy to grab. I’ll log it right after I eat and do a quick check-in on how I feel. If I’m not hungry, I can switch to a small yogurt drink or a dairy-free option. Because my eating is irregular, I’ll focus on one small, stabilizing change at a time and tell you if I need a lighter option or a different approach, especially in the heat. Please remind me if I forget."
