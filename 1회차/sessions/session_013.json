Then have a tiny, easy snack you feel comfortable with, such as half a cup of yogurt with a few berries or a small banana with a thin layer of peanut butter. If hunger feels uncertain, just sip the drink and do a quick grounding exercise: name 5 things you can see and take a slow 4-4-4 breathing for 60 seconds.

    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. I'll start with a small sip of water now. The idea of a tiny yogurt with berries feels possible, but I might slow down and wait a bit to see how I feel before attempting that snack. I'll check back in a little to let you know what I did."
