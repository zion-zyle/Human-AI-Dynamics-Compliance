Ultra-simple plan for now: 1) Find shade and sit for 2 minutes to cool down. 2) Sip a glass of water slowly. 3) Take a 60-second calm breath: inhale for 4, hold 1, exhale for 6. 4) If you feel safe and it’s okay, you may have a small grape as a tiny snack. If distress or symptoms persist, pause and reach out for clinician support. We’ll check in again soon and adjust as needed.",

The user has anorexia and high emotional sensitivity, so I chose ultra-simple, low-effort actions—hydration, shade, and brief grounding—to minimize distress and cognitive load while staying safe.",
    "user_utterance": "Thank you for the gentle steps. I’ll try to start with hydration and the short breathing exercise today—one small, doable step at a time. I’m cautious about changing eating patterns, so I’ll wait for clear reassurance that this won’t overwhelm me. If I feel safe, I might consider a tiny grape later, but only with support.
