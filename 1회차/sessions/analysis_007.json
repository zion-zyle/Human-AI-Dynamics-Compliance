  "basis": "The user explicitly commits to trying the coin-sized bite today but adds 'if I feel able,' indicating a conditional (partial) action rather than full execution. This shows willingness to engage with the plan but with precautions and flexibility.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": " Mild internal tension between wanting a gentler, low-pressure start and the urge to engage in concrete, trackable steps. The user advocates safety and sustainability, signaling cautious optimism mixed with concern about potential overwhelm.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Occasional self-judgment about missing steps is possible, but tempered by self-compassion. Worries about being pressured by reminders and memory lapses may surface, with a tendency to downplay progress when steps are skipped.",

  "coaching_notes": "Keep the plan ultra-simple and optional. Emphasize one cue at a time, allow a very small weekly goal, and keep daily check-ins optional. Offer a clear pause option and a friend-check-in alternative to reminders. Provide grounding techniques (e.g., 5-4-3-2-1) as optional supports. Monitor for safety concerns and be ready to involve the care team if disordered thoughts arise. Celebrate small progress without judgment."
