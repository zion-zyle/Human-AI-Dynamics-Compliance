Options: a small yogurt cup with a few berries; a slice of toast with a thin layer of nut butter; or a cheese stick with a few crackers. If you’re not hungry, choose a tiny, easy-to-tolerate item you can still log (mood, energy, hunger). After eating, log your hunger and energy and note any anxiety. Keep a backup snack ready (e.g., another yogurt or a fruit cup) in case you miss the main plan. Hydrate with cool water to help with the heat. If you want, tell me what you have on hand and I’ll tailor the exact choice.",
