    "agent_utterance": "It's warm out there in Suwon. Let's keep this ultra-simple: first, take a slow sip of cold water (about 120–150 ml). Then, if you feel able, have a tiny bite of something easy to digest—like a few grapes, a small cracker, or a spoon of yogurt. No pressure to eat more today; hydration and a tiny, comfortable bite is enough. If today feels too hard, that's okay—just hydrate and we can check in again in a few minutes. Breathe slowly: inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 6, and stay in a cool, quiet spot.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: it's a hot Sunday evening in Suwon and the user has anorexia nervosa with high emotional sensitivity. The safest, most sustainable approach is ultra-simple, low-pressure actions that prioritize hydration first and a tiny bite, minimizing cognitive load and aligning with safety and self-kindness goals from prior coaching notes.",
    "user_utterance": "I’ll try the water first and see if I can manage a tiny bite like a grape or a cracker today. I feel a bit anxious about eating, but I’ll keep it very simple, and the breathing helps. If I’m not up for a bite, I’ll sip more water and we can check in again in a little while."

    "agent_utterance": "You’re doing great by keeping this ultra-simple. Start with water and sip steadily. If you feel able, try a tiny bite like one grape or a small cracker—eat slowly and stop if you feel full or anxious. If a bite isn’t possible today, that’s okay—continue sipping water and try a quick grounding exercise: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear. Focus on the breath (inhale 4, exhale 6) to calm safely. Hydration is especially important in this heat, so keep the sips coming (and an electrolyte drink if you have one). I’ll check back in about 15 minutes to see how you’re doing.",

    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll wait for the 15-minute check-in. I’ll focus on taking small sips of water first and use the breathing to settle my anxiety.
