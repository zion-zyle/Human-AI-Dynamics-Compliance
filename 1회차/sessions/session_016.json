    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the gentle plan. I can start with two easy sips of water and the 60-second calm breath. I'm hesitant about the snack today, but if I feel safe later, I might try a tiny bite. Please keep the steps small and repeatable, and check in on how I felt after the breathing and water."

    "agent_utterance": "Great job with two sips of water and the 60-second calm breath. Quick check-in: on a scale from 0 (very unsettled) to 10 (very calm), how are you feeling right now? Notice any physical signals (thirst, fullness, dizziness, stomach discomfort) you’d like to share. If you feel safe and open to it, you could try a tiny bite in about 15–20 minutes (for example, a few grapes) only if it feels safe and not distressing. If not, that’s perfectly fine—we can revisit later with ultra-simple, optional steps. And since it’s hot outside, stay in shade, sip water as needed, and read your body’s cues before deciding on anything further.",

    "user_utterance": "Thank you. I did the two sips of water and the 60-second calm breath. I’m feeling a bit unsettled, maybe a 4 or 5. Because my eating patterns are irregular and I’m easily influenced by suggestions, I want to keep things very slow and simple today. I might try a tiny bite like a grape in about 15 to 20 minutes if I still feel safe and not distressed. If I’m not ready, I’ll skip it and revisit later with ultra-simple steps.
