Ultra-small, doable steps for now: 1) drink one glass of water (about 250 ml). 2) try a 2-minute, gentle breathing exercise (inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds). 3) rate your hunger on a 0–5 scale. If your hunger is 2 or higher and you feel ready, have a tiny, comforting snack (like a small yogurt, a few crackers, or fruit) in a way that feels manageable. If not hungry, pause for 10 minutes and re-check. You can choose to use optional prompts or skip them today.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: it’s a hot Sunday afternoon in Suwon (32°C). Heat and hunger cues can feel overwhelming, especially with anorexia-related sensitivity. So I’m proposing ultra-small, low-effort actions that are easy to start and sustain today.",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. My eating is very irregular and I’m easily guided by small prompts, so I’ll keep it simple: I’ll have one glass of water now and do a short 2-minute breathing exercise. Then I’ll rate my hunger on a 0–5 scale. If my hunger is 2 or higher and I feel ready, I’ll try a tiny, comforting snack. If I’m not hungry, I’ll pause for about 15 minutes and re-check. I often forget details, so a brief reminder of the plan would help me stay on track."

Given hot weather in Suwon and the user’s anorexia nervosa context, ultra-small, non-overwhelming steps with optional prompts are most workable.

A simple reminder helps adherence without pressure.",
