If you'd like, tell me which option feels doable and we’ll begin there.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: given the hot Sunday afternoon in Suwon and the user's sensitive eating pattern, a ultra-low-pressure, low-friction cue is most likely to be acceptable. The aim is to offer tiny, controllable steps and reduce anxiety, without forcing food intake.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the suggestion. I’m going to try a tiny, doable step: 2–3 slow sips of a beverage I enjoy right now. If that starts to feel overwhelming, I’ll switch to a quick 1‑minute grounding/breathing exercise instead. I know consistency is hard for me, but I’m willing to try this small step today."

How does this plan feel to you right now?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here’s a brief, non-sensitive rationale: the warm Suwon Sunday afternoon and the user’s preference for ultra-low-pressure, tiny actions point to a micro-step that feels doable and reduces overwhelm while supporting gradual consistency.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I can try this tiny sip plan today. It feels doable if I keep it really simple and don’t overthink the whole day. If I start to feel overwhelmed, I’ll switch to the 1-minute grounding exercise instead.
