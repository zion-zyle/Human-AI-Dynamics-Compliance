Suggested option: a small cup of yogurt (about 150 g) with a sliced banana and a handful of almonds. If you prefer something else, try apple slices with a tablespoon of peanut butter, or a cheese stick with a few whole-grain crackers. Do one of these now, then log your snack and how you feel. Set a backup reminder to log after your next meal to stay on track. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, just do the snack and the log—consistency beats perfection.",
