If you’re not hungry, just water and a quick log. Set a reminder for around 7:30 PM to review how you’re feeling and note your small win. Hydration is important in the heat, so sip water steadily through the evening.",
    "agent_monologue": "I'm unable to share my detailed internal chain-of-thought. Here's a concise summary of factors considered: hot Sunday afternoon in Suwon (32°C) can raise fatigue and reduce appetite; the user has anorexia nervosa and benefits from ultra-simple, low-effort actions; prior coaching notes indicate high likelihood of adherence to a 200 ml water intake, a tiny snack, and logging around 7:30 PM. With that in mind, I chose an ultra-simple plan that minimizes decision fatigue and memory load: keep it small, immediate, and trackable—water, a tiny snack, and a quick log.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the simple plan. I'll try to start today with 200 ml of water now. If I can, I'll add a tiny snack like half a banana or a small yogurt, or I'll just log the water. I'll set the 7:30 PM reminder to check how I'm feeling and note a small win. I know stability is hard for me, so I'll keep it ultra-simple and non-pressuring."
