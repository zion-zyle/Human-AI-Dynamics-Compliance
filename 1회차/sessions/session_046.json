The plan favors a small snack with protein and a short, gentle movement to support energy and mood without adding complexity.",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. I’ll aim for a tiny, regular step today: hydrate and have a small snack (like yogurt with berries) plus a 5-minute stretch. I’m a bit anxious about eating but hopeful a simple, predictable routine can help. I’ll try setting a reminder for tomorrow and, after the snack, name one feeling and one need."

Keep it calm and doable: drink some water, have a small snack you described (yogurt with berries or a mild alternative), and do a gentle 5-minute stretch in a cool, indoors spot.

I’m feeling a bit anxious about eating, so I’ll aim for ultra-simple: hydrate and see if I can have a very small snack, but I may start with just water or a bite if that feels safer. If I do eat the snack, I’ll name one feeling and one need afterward. I like that the plan is predictable and low-pressure, though I might struggle with consistency.
