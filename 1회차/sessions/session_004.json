If your hunger is 2 or higher, have a light snack you enjoy (examples: yogurt with fruit, a small banana with a thin layer of peanut butter, a rice cake with a bit of cheese, or a small handful of almonds).

Hydration and a quick breathing exercise support mood and appetite cues, and the hunger check directs a snack only if it's warranted by their current state.",
