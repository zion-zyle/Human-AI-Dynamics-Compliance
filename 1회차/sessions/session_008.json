If you feel able, try one coin-sized bite of a preferred snack (for example, a small piece of yogurt with a berry, a single grape, or a tiny rice cake). Eat it slowly and without pressure. If that feels like too much today, you can simply sip a small nourishing drink or wait until you feel ready. No obligation—your pace matters. If you’d like support, you can ask a friend to check in, or use a quick grounding technique (5-4-3-2-1). Also, stay hydrated with a small glass of water or a cooled drink to cope with the heat. If you’d prefer, we can set a tiny goal for tomorrow instead.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private step-by-step internal reasoning, but here's a brief rationale: the weather is hot and it's Sunday afternoon, which can dampen appetite and increase overwhelm. The user has anorexia nervosa and benefits from ultra-simple, low-pressure actions. Aligning with the planned very small cue, I propose an ultra-simple, optional option with easy alternatives and supports (pause option, friend check-in, grounding) to reduce pressure.",
    "user_utterance": "That last suggestion feels really hard for me right now. My eating is very irregular, and I tend to respond to ideas only when things feel more stable. If possible, I’d like to try something tiny today—just a small bite of something I like, eaten slowly and without pressure (for example, a piece of fruit or a spoonful of yogurt). If today is too much, can we set a tiny goal for tomorrow and maybe a simple reminder or supportive check-in? I sometimes forget, so a gentle cue would help."

If today feels too much, we’ll set a tiny goal for tomorrow instead: choose one small bite you enjoy and eat it slowly at a time that works for you (for example, around 1:00 PM). To support memory, here are two gentle cue options you can use: 1) a phone reminder: 'Time for a tiny bite—slowly and without pressure.' 2) a brief check-in from a friend. If you’d like, tell me your preferred time tomorrow and I’ll draft a ready-to-use reminder you can copy-paste. And since it’s hot out, consider having a small glass of water alongside your bite.",
