Set a firm reminder for 6:00 PM to have another tiny bite with water. If you’re not hungry, just sip water and rest for a moment—hydration helps in the heat.

Here’s a brief summary of factors I considered: the hot afternoon in Suwon (32°C) on Sunday, your anorexia recovery context, and the need for ultra-simple, cue-based steps. I chose a tiny, actionable action that fits your plan (grape-sized bite with water) and a concrete reminder at 6:00 PM to support consistency.",
