Have this as your first bite in the early evening today. Set a daily 6:00 PM check-in reminder to log that you completed the bite and how you felt. We’ll keep this fixed plan for several days to reduce memory load; if you want more variety later, we can add up to three additional bite-sized options while keeping the 6:00 PM check-in as a constant.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: the hot Sunday afternoon in Suwon can dampen appetite and make sticking to routines harder. A fixed first bite plus a predictable 6:00 PM check-in reduces cognitive load and supports consistent eating for someone with anorexia nervosa.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll try the fixed first bite you suggested: 120 g Greek yogurt with 1/4 cup berries and a light drizzle of honey, as my early-evening bite. The fixed routine feels helpful given my irregular eating patterns. I’ll also set the 6:00 PM check-in reminder and log how I felt afterward. I’m a bit anxious about sticking to this every day, but stability is appealing. If I don’t manage the fixed bite some days, could we add a simple backup option (like a small yogurt cup or fruit) for later that evening so I still have something to log? I’m ready to give this a try for several days and then we can adjust as needed."

    "agent_utterance": "Great idea to have a simple backup. If life gets busy or you’re not able to do the fixed bite, you can use one of these quick, loggable options in the evening: \n\nBackup option A: 1 small yogurt cup (about 100–120 g) with a light drizzle of honey if you’d like. \nBackup option B: 1 piece of fruit (apple, banana, or pear) or a small fruit cup (~150 g). If you want a touch more, you can pair it with a spoon of yogurt, but keep it simple. \n\nHow to use it: pick one backup option in advance, aim to have it by around 6:15–6:30 PM, and log what you ate plus how you felt. If you’re feeling anxious about sticking to the plan, note the moment you chose the backup and what helped you proceed (e.g., it being quick, the reminder, knowing you have a simple option).\n\nWe’ll keep the fixed bite as the default for several days, and you can switch to backups on tougher days. Also, given it’s hot (32°C in Suwon), make sure you stay hydrated and keep the bite cool if possible. We’ll adjust based on how you do in the next several days.",

    "user_utterance": "Appreciate the backup options—having a quick, loggable fallback reduces my anxiety about sticking to the plan. The fixed bite feels doable on most days, but my irregular schedule means I worry I won’t always manage 6:00 PM. I’m glad you included a simple backup; I’ll plan to use Backup Option A or B if the evening gets hectic, and I’ll log what I ate and how I felt. I might also set multiple reminders (e.g., 5:50 PM and 6:15 PM) to accommodate memory lapses. Since I’m sensitive to heat, I’ll try to keep the bite cool and have water nearby. My main goal is stability over time, so I’m comfortable starting this for several days and then reassessing. If I miss the exact timing, would you still want me to log something and note I used the backup? I’m ready to give this a proper try, step by step, rather than overhauling my routine all at once."
