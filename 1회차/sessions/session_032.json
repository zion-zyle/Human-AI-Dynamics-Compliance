Let’s keep it ultra-simple today: 1) Try the tiny yogurt cue: place 1/2 teaspoon of yogurt on your tongue, notice the taste for a moment, then swallow if comfortable. If that feels activating, skip the yogurt and log it; you can substitute with a tiny sip of something nourishing instead. 2) Take two slow breaths: in for 4 counts, out for 4 counts. 3) Set a daily reminder for 7:30 PM to repeat this small routine. It’s hot outside, so have water nearby and stay hydrated. Please log what you did (or if you skipped) so we can track progress.",
