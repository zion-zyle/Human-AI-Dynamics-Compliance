I’ll start with a small yogurt cup that I can finish in a minute, and I’ll log it right after I eat. If that feels too much on tougher days, I can switch to a banana with a few almonds. A gentle reminder would help me stay on track when my eating patterns feel irregular."

A gentle reminder can help with irregular eating patterns while keeping safety and well-being in mind.",
