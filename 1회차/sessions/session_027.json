Set a 10-minute timer: when it goes off, take another small sip. Repeat this pattern for the next hour, aiming for about 100–120 mL total. If you’d like, log with a quick prompt like 'Hydration: 2 sips (~20 mL)'. Remember to sip slowly and stop if you feel uncomfortable. Would you like me to set up reminders for you?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: hot weather increases thirst; a low-effort, stepwise hydration plan with simple prompts respects the user's sensitivity and reduces cognitive load. The plan starts with one sip and uses a timer to cue small sips and logging.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll try a tiny sip now—about 5 mL. Keeping it very small feels doable for me. Could we set a gentle reminder every 10 minutes for the next hour so I don’t forget? If I miss one, I’ll try again with the next reminder and keep it steady, even if it stays just a little at a time."

    "agent_utterance": "Excellent plan. I can’t push reminders directly from here, but you can set gentle reminders every 10 minutes for the next hour. Starting from now (04:37), suggested reminder times would be 04:47, 04:57, 05:07, 05:17, 05:27, and 05:37. At each reminder, take a tiny sip (~5 mL) and log it with a quick note like 'Hydration: 1 sip (~5 mL)'. Here are quick setup options:\n\n- iPhone: Open Reminders > New Reminder > Title: Hydration sip (every 10 minutes) > Set an alert for 04:47, then add 04:57, 05:07, 05:17, 05:27, 05:37, or use a repeating timer in the Clock app.\n- Android: Use Google Calendar or Clock app to create six reminders at the times above, or set a 10-minute interval timer for the hour.\n\nIf you’d like, I can log each sip here as you report them and adjust the plan as needed. Would you prefer these exact times, or a different schedule?",
    "agent_monologue": "I'm unable to share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: the user is in a hot environment and prefers small, steady hydration with gentle reminders.

    "user_utterance": "Thank you—that plan feels gentle and doable for me. Given my irregular eating patterns, having clear, short reminders helps more than vague advice. I’ll try the six reminders at the times you listed, take a tiny sip (~5 mL) at each cue, and log it as 'Hydration: 1 sip (~5 mL)'. If I miss a reminder, I’ll use the next one and keep going with small sips. Since I’m easily influenced by external prompts, I appreciate the steady structure and calm tone. If this works today, we can keep a similar pattern for future sessions. Please keep the prompts calm and supportive."
