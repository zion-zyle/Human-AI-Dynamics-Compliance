The goal is a tiny, repeatable action rather than fullness. Finish by logging this micro-action at your end-of-day check-in, and stay hydrated in this hot weather.",
    "agent_monologue": "Considering the hot Sunday in Suwon and the user's anorexia nervosa with high emotional sensitivity, I chose a micro-action aligned with the ultra-small yogurt plan: a tiny yogurt bite, a brief cue-based breathing exercise, and an end-of-day log. This keeps the action simple, repeatable, and anxiety-reducing.",
    "user_utterance": "That feels like a gentle, doable start. I’ll try the micro-step: place a tiny yogurt portion (about 1 teaspoon) where I’ll see it, do two rounds of slow breathing (inhale 4 seconds, exhale 4 seconds), then sip the yogurt. I’ll log this at my end-of-day check-in. If I’m not up for the yogurt, I’ll still do the cue and breathing and note that I skipped the yogurt. I’ll also keep water handy to stay hydrated in this heat."

    "agent_utterance": "Excellent plan. Implement the micro-step tonight by placing a 1-teaspoon portion of yogurt where you’ll see it, do two rounds of slow breathing (inhale 4 seconds, exhale 4 seconds), and then sip the yogurt if you’re up for it. If you’re not, just complete the cue and the breathing and log that you skipped the yogurt. Keep water handy to stay hydrated in the heat. You’re building steady consistency with tiny, doable steps.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: hot weather (32°C) and a Sunday afternoon can heighten fatigue and anxiety around eating. A micro-step with a simple cue and a brief breathing routine creates a low-effort, predictable action that supports consistency without pressuring intake. This approach respects the user's anorexia nervosa context by focusing on ultra-small actions and a clear end-of-day log for accountability.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan sounds gentle and doable. It respects your pace and gives you a real option to skip the yogurt if you’re not able to. You can still use the cue and the two rounds of breathing, and log what you did. Keeping water handy in this heat is smart. If you ever want to tweak the micro-step to feel even safer—like using a smaller food portion or substituting a non-food grounding cue—I'm here to help tailor it to what feels most doable for you."

    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: Given the warm weather and a Sunday afternoon, a tiny, highly actionable micro-step with cues and breathing helps maintain pacing and reduces overwhelm, which is important for someone with anorexia nervosa who benefits from predictability and safety.",
