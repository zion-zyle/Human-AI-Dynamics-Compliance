If you can, set a timer for 5 minutes and plan a quick check‑in at 5:00 PM. If you're not feeling up to sipping right now, that's completely fine—your pace matters. Hydration can support energy and mood in this heat, and small, easy steps are a good start.",
    "agent_monologue": "Context: hot Sunday afternoon in Suwon. User with anorexia nervosa and high emotional sensitivity. To minimize friction and support adherence, I choose a very low‑effort hydration cue: 2–3 slow sips now, and keep the drink in sight as a cue. This aligns with the tiny-sip plan and a 5:00 PM check‑in plus tomorrow’s 3:00 PM reminder. The approach is supportive, non‑punitive, and aims to reduce cognitive load while prioritizing hydration and mood stability in heat.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I'll try to take 2 slow sips of water now. I’ll set a 5‑minute timer and check back in. If I can’t do much, I’ll at least sip a little and see how it goes. I appreciate the gentle nudge."

    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a brief, non-sensitive rationale: hot weather in Suwon on Sunday afternoon increases dehydration risk, so a short, low-friction hydration cue with a timer supports the user's commitment to small, manageable steps without pressure.",
