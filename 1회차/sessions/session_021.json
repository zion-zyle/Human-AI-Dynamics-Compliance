Choose one option and use a pre-measured amount: 1) olive oil drizzled on vegetables or bread, 2) peanut or almond butter stirred into yogurt, or 3) plain yogurt with a drizzle of honey. Keep the topping readily accessible so you don’t have to think about it. If it’s very hot today, the yogurt option may feel lighter.

I’d prefer to start small—maybe 1 tablespoon instead of 2—and I think I’d feel more comfortable with yogurt plus honey, especially when it’s hot. I’ll pre-measure and keep it handy, and set a simple reminder after meals. If today feels too overwhelming, is it okay to skip this meal and retry the next one?"

Since it’s hot today (32°C in Suwon) and your meals are irregular, starting with 1 tablespoon of yogurt with a drizzle of honey after your next meal is a sensible, lighter micro-step. Pre-measure and keep it handy, and set a simple reminder to go off after meals. If today feels overwhelming, it’s absolutely okay to skip this meal and retry with the next one—consistency over time matters more than perfection. When you try again, aim for the next meal and stick to the 1 tablespoon target. Log what you did so we can adjust as needed.
