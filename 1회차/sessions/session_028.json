Try this simple option: 150 g plain yogurt (or a dairy-free yogurt) + 1/2 sliced banana + a tablespoon of chopped almonds. Accompany with a glass of water or a low-sugar electrolyte drink. Eat slowly in a calm space, and check in with how you feel about 20 minutes later.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: considering the hot weather, Sunday afternoon, and a need for lightweight, controllable intake due to anxiety around eating, propose a small, easy snack with protein and hydration to stabilize energy without overwhelming you.",
    "user_utterance": "Thank you for the snack idea. It feels doable, though I’m anxious about eating a set amount. I’d like to try a smaller version today (for example, about 100 g yogurt with a thin slice of banana and a few almonds, or a dairy-free option if that’s easier). I’ll drink water, eat slowly in a calm space, and check how I feel in about 20 minutes. If this still feels too much, could we start even smaller and build up gradually? I want to be honest about what I can manage right now."

    "agent_utterance": "Great job prioritizing what feels doable. Try one of these simple options today: Primary option (about 100 kcal): 100 g yogurt (regular or dairy-free) + a thin slice of banana + 5–7 almonds, plus a glass of water. Eat slowly in a calm space and check in about 20 minutes. If that feels like too much, start smaller: 60 g yogurt + a thin banana slice + 3–4 almonds (or 60 g dairy-free yogurt). If needed, go to 40–50 g yogurt with a tiny banana piece and 1–2 almonds. You can gradually increase by small steps (e.g., +10–20 g yogurt every few days) as you’re able. You’re doing great by honoring what’s doable today.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: in hot weather and with sensitivity to portions, starting with a very small, protein-containing snack gives you a manageable entry point.

    "user_utterance": "Thank you for the flexible plan. I am nervous about a fixed amount, but I want to try something very small today. I think I’ll start with the tiniest option you suggested: about 40–50 g yogurt (regular or dairy-free) with a sliver of banana and 1 almond, plus a glass of water. I’ll eat slowly in a calm space and check how I feel about 20 minutes later. If that still feels like too much, we can go even smaller (for example 20–30 g yogurt with a tiny banana piece). I’m trying to be honest about what I can manage right now and I’m open to gradually increasing as I feel more stable. Could we revisit this plan in a couple of days and adjust based on how I’m doing?"
