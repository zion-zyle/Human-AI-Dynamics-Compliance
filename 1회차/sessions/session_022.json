Pair it with a glass of water or an electrolyte beverage. Keep it gentle and non-forced—aim for steady intake without pressure on this hot, Sunday afternoon. I can check in in about 3 days to see how you’re feeling and adjust if needed. Would you like me to set a reminder for that check-in?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: it's a hot Sunday afternoon in Suwon with high emotional sensitivity. The plan is to propose a small, cooling, easy-to-ingest snack with some protein to support intake, plus hydration, and to set up a light 3-day check-in to assess comfort and adjust if needed.",
    "user_utterance": "Thank you for the suggestion. I think I can try a tiny portion today—perhaps 1/4 cup of plain yogurt with a few berries and a small sip of water. I'll eat slowly and see how it feels. A reminder for the 3-day check-in would be helpful; please set that up."

I’ll frame the check-in for Wednesday at 4:17 PM Korea Standard Time (local Suwon time).

Since reminders matter to me but I can feel overwhelmed, I’ll rely on in-chat prompts and the ready-to-use reminder text you provide to paste into my calendar or notes. Here’s a simple text I’d like to use: 'Wed 16:17 KST — 3-day check-in: have a tiny snack (1/4 cup plain yogurt with berries), eat slowly, note hunger and how you feel; reply here with a brief reflection.' If you want, you can also post a short reminder at 15:30 KST in chat."
