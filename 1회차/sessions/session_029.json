If dairy-free, try 2–3 tablespoons plant yogurt with berries. Alternatively, you can have a small rice cake with a light smear of peanut or almond butter (about 1/2 teaspoon). Or pick fruit like 1 small peach wedge or 1 medium apple slice. Keep it cool in the fridge to beat the heat and pair with a quick sip of water or an electrolyte drink. If appetite is low, start with just a bite and pause—you can revisit later. If you’d like, I can set a gentle check-in after dinner to see how this felt and adjust for tomorrow.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: given the hot weather, the user’s anorexia nervosa context, and the desire for ultra-small, non-threatening steps, a tiny, pre-planned snack that’s easy to finish quickly supports intake without triggering anxiety. I’ve included dairy and dairy-free options and a simple cadence for check-ins.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the simple, low-pressure option. I think I can manage a tiny snack in about two minutes. I’ll start with 1/4 cup plain yogurt with a few blueberries; if I’m not hungry, I’ll just have a few berries and stop. I’ll keep it in the fridge and have a small sip of water along with it. If I can’t finish, I’ll pause and revisit later. A gentle check-in after dinner would help me reflect on how it felt and plan for tomorrow."
