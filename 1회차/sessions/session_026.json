Keep the cup visible where you usually rest your gaze. Set a 5‑minute timer and when it rings, check back with me about how you feel and whether you'd like to do one more tiny sip or switch to a light snack. If water feels hard, try something refreshing like cucumber-water or a gentle herbal tea. The goal is a low-effort, repeatable habit—no pressure, just consistent tiny steps.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: hot weather and anxiety about sticking to plans make a tiny, observable hydration step ideal.

    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief, high-level rationale: the hot Sunday afternoon in Suwon (32°C) increases hydration needs.
