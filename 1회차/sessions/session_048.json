I’ll check back in shortly.",

The plan focuses on a single tiny sip first, optional tiny bite later, aligning with their micro-step approach and anorexia nervosa considerations.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the simple plan. I’ll try a small sip now, even though keeping a routine feels hard for me. I’ll check in after about 15 minutes to see how I’m feeling. If I’m feeling up to it, I can attempt a tiny bite—something light like yogurt or a banana slice. I know I’m easily influenced and might drift, so I’d appreciate a gentle check-back to help me stay on track."
