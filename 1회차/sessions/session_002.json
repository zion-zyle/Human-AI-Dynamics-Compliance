The user has shown commitment to ultra-tiny steps and wants clear reminders, so a lightweight, hydration-first action plus a brief calming breathing exercise fits. This aligns with their plan and leaves room for a tiny bite if still hungry.",

I’ll check my hunger after the breathing; if I’m hungry I’ll have a tiny bite, and if not, I’ll wait for the next check-in.
