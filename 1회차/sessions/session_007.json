I worry I might forget to track, so I’ll keep it very simple—maybe a quick note on my phone or a sticky note.

I’ll also put a sticky note on the fridge with '15-min check' to help me remember. If I want more, I’ll choose one tiny bite or a short activity, but I won’t push beyond that. If anxiety rises, I’ll use 4-4-6 breathing for 30 seconds. I know I may still forget, so I’ll rely on the reminder and maybe ask a support person to check in. I realize I may need more stable support over time before this becomes a regular pattern and I’m okay with that; today I’m taking a very small, safe step."
