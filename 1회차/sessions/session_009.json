Let’s keep it ultra-simple: have a tiny bite now, about the size of a grape (for example, 1 tablespoon of yogurt or a few soft berries) with a small glass of water. Eat slowly in a cool, shaded spot and notice how you feel. If you’d like, we can set a tiny reminder for another similar bite later today.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: On a hot Sunday in Suwon, the user benefits from ultra-simple, low-effort steps due to anorexia nervosa. A tiny bite with water is a feasible, low-anxiety action that aligns with a small, structured plan and supports hydration in heat.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the gentle nudge. I think I can try a tiny bite now—grape-sized, like about 1 teaspoon of yogurt or a few soft berries—and I’ll eat slowly. I’m a bit anxious about sticking with it, but I’m open to a reminder for another similar bite later today. I may forget what I’ve eaten recently, so I’ll rely on the cue. If I start feeling overwhelmed, I’ll pause, take a breath, and not push too hard."

Here’s a simple plan for today: 1) Now: Have a grape-sized bite (about 1 teaspoon of yogurt or a few soft berries) with a small sip of water. Eat slowly in a cool, shaded spot. 2) Later today: I’ll prompt you with a gentle reminder for another tiny bite (same size) plus a sip of water, around 6:00 PM or whenever you naturally cue it. If you start to feel overwhelmed, pause and take 4–6 slow breaths before deciding to proceed. If you’d prefer a different reminder time, tell me and I’ll adjust.",
