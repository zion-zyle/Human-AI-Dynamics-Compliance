    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private step-by-step internal reasoning, but here's a concise rationale: The weather is hot (32°C) on a Sunday, and the user has anorexia nervosa with high emotional sensitivity. A ultra-simple, low-effort action with an immediate reward and a reminder minimizes cognitive load and supports ongoing compliance. The prior analysis shows the user is inclined to start 200 ml of water now and set a reminder to log in ~15 minutes, so the suggestion should reinforce that concrete plan.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the last suggestion. I want to be honest: big changes feel hard for me, and I tend to follow what is easiest at the moment. I would like to try a tiny, regular step instead: a small snack at the same time each day, something I enjoy and can tolerate. If 3 pm works, I will aim for that, but I might need a gentle reminder because I have trouble remembering meals. If I miss a day, that is okay; we can try again the next day. This feels more doable and could become a stable pattern slowly."

    "agent_utterance": "Fantastic plan. Let’s set up a simple, regular 3:00 PM snack that you can actually tolerate and enjoy. Pick one default option (you can rotate later) and keep it small. Easy, quick choices: - 1 small yogurt cup with a few berries, - a small handful of almonds (about 15–20) with a piece of fruit like a mandarin, - a thin rice cake with a small amount of peanut butter. If you’d like, I can choose one as your default. Reminder ideas: set a daily 2:50 PM prep alert and a 3:00 PM snack reminder on your phone or calendar, or we can use a quick nudge here in this chat. If you miss a day, that’s totally okay—just start again tomorrow. Would you like me to pick a default snack for you and outline exact reminder steps for your device?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here is a concise rationale: the user wants a tiny, regular step, so a fixed 3:00 PM snack provides stability with minimal decision fatigue. Given Suwon's hot afternoon (heat can affect appetite) and the user's difficulty remembering meals, a short, enjoyable snack paired with a simple reminder supports consistency without pressure. The approach is gentle and aims to build a sustainable pattern for someone with anorexia nervosa, emphasizing ease, tolerance, and flexibility if a day is missed.",
