Here's a simple, cue-based plan at about 4/10 effort: 1) Hydrate now: sip 150–200 ml of water slowly. 2) Do a 60-second breath: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 2, exhale for 6. 3) If you feel hungry, wait for a clear hunger cue before eating; if you do eat, choose a small, pre-portioned option you feel safe with (e.g., a small yogurt or a banana). If no hunger cue, pause and check in again in 5 minutes. Hydration and breathing first will help you feel steadier in the heat.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: the hot 32°C Sunday in Suwon and the user's emotional sensitivity call for an ultra-simple, cue-based plan. Focusing on hydration and a short breathing exercise respects the prior commitment and reduces overwhelm, with a conditional snack rule to align with the anorexia nervosa profile.",
    "user_utterance": "Thank you for the simple plan. I can try the hydration and the 60-second breathing first. My eating is very irregular and I often don’t notice clear hunger cues, so the 'wait for hunger' part feels hard for me. Could we adapt this into a tiny, predictable routine—perhaps a fixed snack at the same time most days using foods I feel safe with (like yogurt or a banana), and a small, manageable meal if possible? If I don’t feel hunger, I’ll pause and check back in after 5 minutes as you suggested. I’d also appreciate simple reminders or steps I can repeat daily to help build stability over time."

    "agent_utterance": "Great idea. Here’s a tiny, predictable routine you can follow most days:\n\n- Hydrate now: drink about 200 ml of water slowly.\n- 60-second breathing: inhale 4 seconds, hold 2, exhale 6.\n- Fixed snack time: choose a consistent daily time for a small, pre-portioned snack you feel safe with, for example 4:15 PM. Safe options: 1 small yogurt (about 120–150 g) or 1 medium banana. Have them ready the night before if possible.\n- If you don’t feel clear hunger cues: eat the fixed snack anyway at the scheduled time, then pause and check back in after 5 minutes. If you’re still not hungry, you can skip the second portion and note how you felt.\n- Small, manageable meal (if possible): aim for a tiny, easy-to-digest meal once daily when you can, such as a small bowl of porridge with milk, or a yogurt-plus-fruit combo. Keep portions small and simple.\n- Daily reminders you can use: set a phone alert for snack time (e.g., 4:10 PM as a cue to prepare), keep a bottle of water nearby, and place a simple 1-line note somewhere visible (e.g., “How am I feeling right now?”) to prompt a quick check-in.\n\nIf you’re ever feeling overwhelmed or unsafe, reach out to your clinician or support person right away. This routine is meant to be ultra-simple and supportive, not perfect or prescriptive.",

If hunger cues aren’t clear, I’ll still eat the snack at that time and take a 5-minute pause to check in. To help with memory, I’d like very simple reminders: one phone alert around 4:10 PM, plus a small visible note (on the fridge or phone) that says ‘How am I feeling right now?’ I’ll also try a tiny daily meal when possible, but I’ll keep portions small and easy to digest. If the 4:15 PM slot doesn’t fit some days, could we use a backup time like 1:30 PM or 7:30 PM? I know stability is important, so I’ll aim to follow this most days and share how it goes tomorrow."
