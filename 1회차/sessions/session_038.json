Let’s do an ultra-small step you can actually start now: Option 1 — sip about 150 ml of water and log it. Option 2 — if you’re feeling up to a tiny bite, have about 2 tablespoons of yogurt or a half small banana and log that as well. If you’re not hungry, just log the water and plan a tiny snack 30 minutes later. Which option sounds best, or would you prefer a different ultra-small snack?",
