    "agent_monologue": "Sorry, I can't share my internal step-by-step reasoning. Here's a brief, high-level rationale instead: hot, sunny conditions can increase dehydration and fatigue, so sticking to a single, concrete action (drink 200 ml of water now) plus a quick log helps you stay on track without adding cognitive load. A very small, easy snack option remains available if hunger or anxiety arises later, and a 7:30 PM check-in provides support while keeping things flexible.",
    "user_utterance": "I appreciate the reminder idea. A quick check-in around 7:30 PM feels doable and could help with my irregular eating patterns. I worry I might miss it, so could we also have a gentle nudge a bit earlier or a backup message if I don’t respond?
