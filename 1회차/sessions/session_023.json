Choose one quick snack option and hydrate well: - Option A: 1 small yogurt cup (~120 g) with a handful of berries. - Option B: 1 small banana with 1 teaspoon peanut butter. - Option C: 1 rice cake with a thin layer of nut butter. Pair your choice with a glass of water (or an electrolyte drink). After you snack, note how hungry you feel and any emotions that come up. If this feels like too much, we can scale down to a single item. Would you like me to set a reminder for a snack around 6 PM?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: with hot weather and a Sunday afternoon, a tiny, low-effort snack plus hydration helps steady energy without increasing stress. This aligns with your plan for small, structured steps and flexible pacing.",
    "user_utterance": "Thank you for the snack ideas. I’m feeling anxious about eating today and my pattern is very irregular, so I’d like this to be ultra‑low pressure. Could we start with a tiny, non‑pressuring option—like a half a yogurt cup with a few berries, or even just one plain rice cake? If even that feels too much, a small sip of water works. Also, a reminder around 6 PM would help only if I’m open to it. If I’m not ready or forget, we can pause and revisit later."
