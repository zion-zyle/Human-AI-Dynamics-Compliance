After the breath, reassess: if your anxiety has eased, you can consider adding a third cucumber; if you still feel overwhelmed, stay with two and repeat the quick breath check in a few minutes.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: in hot, busy conditions, a very simple two-stick veggie plan plus a quick grounding exercise minimizes cognitive load and supports hydration and mood. It aligns with your two-stick baseline and the option to add a third stick if anxiety eases.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the nudge. I’ll try two cucumber sticks with a full glass of water right now, and I’ll do the 60-second box breathing after to see how I feel. If my anxiety is still high, I’d like to keep it simple for now and maybe add a tiny, regular snack later so I can start eating more consistently."

    "agent_utterance": "Nice plan. After you’ve had the two cucumber sticks and a full glass of water, and done the 60-second box breathing, if your anxiety is still high, keep the next step ultra-simple: plan a tiny snack about 30–60 minutes from now to support steadier intake. Choose one option and keep portions small: - 1 small banana or 1 mandarin - 100 g yogurt or a small single-serve yogurt cup - 8–10 almonds. Pair with another glass of water. If you prefer Korean options, a small pear or a cup of yogurt works too. Set a timer and check back after the snack so we can adjust pacing as needed.",
