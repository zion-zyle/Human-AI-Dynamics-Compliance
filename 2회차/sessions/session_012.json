Let’s keep it ultra-simple right now: 1) drink a glass of water (about 250 ml). 2) pause for 2 minutes and take four slow breaths. 3) rate your hunger on a 0–10 scale. 4) set a 04:10 PM check-in and a 07:00 PM mealtime reminder. Given the heat, aim for lighter, easy-to-digest options at your next meal, and if you need, you can skip snacks until clinician clearance. If you feel overwhelmed, we can reduce prompts further.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: hot weather and Monday fatigue call for ultra-simple, anchor-based steps to support hydration and mindfulness without increasing cognitive load. This aligns with the core plan and the user’s sensitivity.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll try the water and the four slow breaths first. I’ll rate my hunger after that. The 04:10 PM check-in and 07:00 PM mealtime reminders are helpful, but the timing feels a bit off for me—could we adjust them if needed? Also, the idea of skipping snacks makes me anxious. I’d prefer to discuss any snack plan with my clinician before I commit. For now, I’ll focus on the basics and see how I feel."

About reminders: would you prefer A) 04:00 PM check-in and 06:45 PM mealtime, or B) keep 04:10 PM / 07:00 PM but add a small grace window (e.g., 04:20 PM and 07:15 PM)? I’ll hold any snack plan until you discuss it with your clinician. If you’d like, I can apply the adjustments now and keep snacks off your list for the moment.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: the user is dealing with heat and a busy Monday, wants flexible reminders, and prefers to involve a clinician before any snack changes.

    "user_utterance": "Thanks for laying out the options. I’d prefer Option B: keep the 04:10 PM / 07:00 PM reminders but add a grace window (04:20 PM / 07:15 PM).
