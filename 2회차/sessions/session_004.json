Choose a tiny portion of something you enjoy (for example, 1–2 bites of yogurt with fruit, or a single rice cake with a light topping). Eat slowly and check in with your body every couple of minutes. If you feel full or uncomfortable, stop. If you feel okay, you can continue up to 15–20 minutes total. Sip water to stay hydrated and keep the room cool. Afterward, note how you felt and any signals you’d adjust next time. You’re taking a safe, gentle step forward—and that’s progress.",
    "agent_monologue": "Context-aware reasoning: with a hot 32°C evening in Suwon on a Monday, and considering the user’s anorexia nervosa and high emotional sensitivity, I choose a very-light, structured tasting plan (15–20 minutes) to minimize stress and allow easy monitoring. This aligns with a gradual, safety-focused approach given environmental fatigue and the need for comfort.",
    "user_utterance": "I'm a bit nervous about trying an eating task today, but I want to give it a real try and keep it gentle. I’ll start with something tiny and familiar—a single bite of yogurt with a few berries—eaten slowly over a couple of minutes. I’ll pause and check how my body feels before deciding if I want more, and I’ll stop if I feel full, uncomfortable, or dizzy. If I’m okay after that bite, I might do a little more, but I’ll keep it very small and within the 15-minute window. I’ll sip water, stay in a cool, calm space, and I’ll tell you what I notice about hunger, fullness, or anxiety afterward. Thank you for the slow, supportive approach—it feels doable."
