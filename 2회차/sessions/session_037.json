    "agent_utterance": "Here's a today-tailored, doable plan. Since yogurt still feels scary, you can start with the lighter option today and keep portions small.\n\nDoable snack plan if you’re hungry later (within 1–2 hours):\n- Option A (most doable given anxiety about yogurt): Half of a plain yogurt portion (~60 g). If that still feels too much, stop at a smaller amount or skip it and choose Option B.\n- Option B (alternative): Half a small banana (~50 g).\n- If both feel overwhelming, start with a small sip of water, wait 10–15 minutes, then reassess hunger before choosing a snack.\n\nIf you do choose a snack: hydrate again after eating.\nAnxiety cue: If anxiety spikes, pause and do 3 slow breaths (inhale 4, exhale 6) for 60 seconds before deciding.\n\nNext small step today: In the next 60–90 minutes, rate your hunger from 0–10 and your anxiety from 0–10. If hunger is 4–6 or higher, go with one of the snack options above (start with half yogurt if you choose it). If anxiety is high, do the 3-breath reset first, then decide. Want me to tailor this to exactly how hungry you feel right now or adjust the time window?\n",

    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the today-tailored plan. I think I can do the lighter option today since yogurt still feels scary. I’ll start with half of the yogurt portion (about 30 g) to see how it sits, and if that feels okay I can gradually go to 60 g. If 30 g feels too little, I’ll switch to half a small banana instead (about 50 g). I’ll check in 60-90 minutes and rate my hunger and anxiety. If my hunger is 4-6 or higher, I’ll choose one of the snack options you outlined. If my anxiety is high, I’ll do the 3 slow breaths before deciding. It would help to have a gentle reminder to stay on track, given my irregular pattern. Could you nudge me around that time and help me adjust if needed?"

If anxiety is high, pause for 3 slow breaths (inhale 4, exhale 6) for 60 seconds before deciding. Hydrate again after the snack.

Since yogurt still feels scary, starting with 30 g sounds doable, and I can slowly work up to 60 g if I am comfortable.

If anxiety is high, I will pause for 3 slow breaths before deciding. A soft reminder around that time would really help me stay on track, and I would prefer a chat prompt or a timer on my phone to nudge me. If I miss the window today, how should we adjust? And could we also add a quick reminder to sip water before and after the snack? I am hoping this steady, small approach will work with my irregular pattern."
