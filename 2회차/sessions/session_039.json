Then take a 60-second slow-breath grounding exercise. After that, set a 60–90 minute timer and check in on your hunger, mood, and thirst. If you’re not hungry yet, you can just sip more water and note how you feel. This keeps action tiny and doable while giving you quick feedback.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a brief summary of factors guiding my suggestion: it's a hot, busy Monday late afternoon in Suwon, which can dampen energy and increase stress around eating. The user has shown strong compliance with small, structured steps in the past. So I’m offering a very simple, low-effort plan that provides hydration, a controlled snack, and a quick grounding moment to reduce overwhelm.",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. A tiny snack feels safer today, so I’ll try the 30 g yogurt with a few berries and a tall glass of water. I’ll do the 60-second breathing to calm down first, and then set a 60–90 minute timer to check in on my hunger and mood. If I’m still not hungry, I’ll just note how I feel and sip more water. If this still feels overwhelming, could we adjust to something even smaller or different—like just the water or a tiny bite later?"

    "agent_utterance": "Great idea to keep it ultra-simple today. If the full snack feels like too much right now, choose one of these ultra-small paths:\n\n- Path A (lowest effort): Just water now, do the 60-second breathing, then set a 60–90 minute check-in on hunger, mood, and thirst.\n\n- Path B (tiny bite later): After the breath, if you’re still not hungry, wait 15–20 minutes and try a tiny bite such as 2–3 almonds or a small handful of berries, then reassess.\n\n- Path C (stay with plan if doable): If you feel up to it, proceed with 30 g yogurt + a few berries and a tall glass of water, followed by the 60-second breath and a 60–90 minute check-in.\n\nHydration is key in the heat today—sip water as needed. If eating feels overwhelming, it’s okay to skip the snack and just note how you feel and drink water instead.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: the user wants ultra-small, low-effort options given potential overwhelm and hot weather. Providing micro-adjustments keeps options open while staying aligned with the current plan.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for breaking this down so simply. I think I’ll go with Path A for today: start with water after a quick 60‑second breathing, then set a 60–90 minute check‑in on hunger, mood, and thirst. Eating still feels scary right now, so this ultra‑low‑effort plan feels the safest. If I’m not hungry after the check‑in, I’ll just note how I feel and keep sipping water. If the thought of eating remains overwhelming, could we keep today to fluids and revisit food tomorrow? And if I begin to feel lightheaded or extremely anxious, I’ll reach out to someone supportive right away."
