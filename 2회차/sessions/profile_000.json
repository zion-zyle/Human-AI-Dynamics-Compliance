    "user_utterance": "My meals are pretty variable—some days I skip breakfast and eat very late. A tiny, gentle idea for today: pick one small snack and try to have it at around the same time, with no pressure. For example, keep a small cup of yogurt with a few berries handy and eat a few bites at around 10:30 am if you can. If you're not hungry, that's fine—just let the snack be visible and give yourself permission to take a bite when you feel ready. The key is a tiny, doable step, not a big overhaul."

    "user_utterance": "I'm fairly receptive to gentle prompts. Tiny ideas like a small snack at a consistent time feel doable as long as there's no pressure or guilt if I miss it. I’d prefer prompts that are supportive and specific—e.g., one daily reminder at around 10:30 am to have a small yogurt with berries, with no blame if I’m not hungry. Visual cues help me, like a sticky note or a phone alarm. If I start the day with nothing, I’d still like the option to try the snack later. So yes, I’m open to simple, non-pressuring nudges, just keep it soft and optional."

    "user_utterance": "Stress and mood definitely shape my eating. When I'm anxious or overwhelmed, I tend to skip meals or eat irregularly. In calmer moments or when I’m in a more relaxed environment, I can follow a small snack plan, but it has to stay optional and gentle. I respond best to cues like a sticky note or a phone alarm around 10:30, and I’m okay with trying a tiny bite even if it’s later, as long as there’s no pressure. I don’t want to feel guilty if I’m not hungry or if I miss a cue—being supportive matters more than strict timing. If you have another soft, non-pressuring prompt to try, I’m open to it, as long as it respects my pace."

I’d like any guidance to stay optional and gentle—tiny prompts that don’t guilt me, like a 10:30 reminder for a small snack, with flexible timing and permission to skip or delay if I’m not hungry.

I want the ability to pause or skip if I’m stressed or overwhelmed and try again later. Visual cues help me (sticky note on the fridge or a phone alarm).
