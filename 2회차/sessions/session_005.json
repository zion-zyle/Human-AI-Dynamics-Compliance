Let's keep it ultra-tiny and doable: 1) Drink one glass (about 250 ml) of water now. 2) Have a small protein snack within the next 60 minutes—options: a handful of almonds (15–20 nuts) or a small cup of yogurt (about 150 ml). If you're not hungry right now, just start with the water and plan the snack later. Ready-to-copy reminder: 'Water now + tiny protein snack within the next hour.'",
