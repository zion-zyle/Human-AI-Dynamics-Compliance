  "basis": "The user explicitly commits to starting the core steps (water, 2-minute pause, four slow breaths) and to rate hunger, with a 04:10 check-in and 07:00 mealtime reminder. They express willingness to adapt prompts to pause-triggered use and to skip snacks until clinician clearance, indicating strong alignment with the plan.",

Some minor internal tension around snack intake due to anorexia but mitigated by clinician clearance and anchored routine.",
