Please drink a cold glass of water now (about 200–250 ml), and choose a micro-snack you can finish in one bite: options include 2–3 grapes, a small apple slice, or a single cucumber slice with a tiny bit of yogurt. After you sip, try a quick 60-second breathing cycle: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4. Then check back in in a couple of minutes to log how you feel and confirm your next ultra-small step.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: it's a hot Monday afternoon in Suwon (32°C), so prioritizing quick hydration and a very small, easy-to-digest snack helps maintain energy and reduce anxiety without overhauling eating habits. The user is emotionally sensitive, so the guidance remains ultra-simple, plus a brief breathing cue to alleviate heat-related tension and keep momentum aligned with the micro-snack approach.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll try the small snack and water. I’ll start with 2–3 grapes and a quick sip of water, and then do the 60-second 4-4-4 breathing. I’m a bit nervous about eating, but I’ll report back in a couple of minutes on how I feel and what the next tiny step should be."

    "agent_monologue": "Brief reasoning: In the hot, Monday context (32°C, Suwon) with the user’s sensitivity to eating, ultra-small steps that combine hydration, gentle movement, and optional tiny snacks are appropriate.
