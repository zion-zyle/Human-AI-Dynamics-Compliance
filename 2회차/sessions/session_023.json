Pick whichever fits best today, or save for tomorrow if today feels overwhelming:\n\n- Today (easy first step): Have a small yogurt or a smoothie sip of about 40–60 ml. Sip slowly and stop after a tiny amount if you want. Then log it.\n\n- Tomorrow option (if today feels hard): We can do the exact same tiny option tomorrow morning or afternoon.\n\nSimple reminder you can set (copy/paste into your reminders):\n- 'Eat a tiny snack (yogurt or smoothie) and log it now.'\n\nIf you tell me your preferred reminder time, I’ll tailor the wording and time for you.",

    "user_utterance": "That tiny plan feels doable and not pressuring. I think I could try a small yogurt or smoothie sip, about 40 ml to start, and log it right away.
