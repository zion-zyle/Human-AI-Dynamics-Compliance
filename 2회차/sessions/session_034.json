You can adjust the bite quantity based on how you feel—flexibility is allowed.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full private reasoning, but here’s a brief rationale: facing a hot 32°C Monday in Suwon can raise stress and appetite fluctuations. A short, concrete plan with hydration and a quick breath exercise helps you feel in control without pressure, aligning with your preference for flexibility and managing anxiety.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll try that. I’ll drink water now and do the 1‑minute box breathing. I’ll rate my hunger honestly. If it’s 4 or more, I’ll have a tiny, pre‑planned bite—like a few almonds or a small piece of fruit—and I’ll keep it very small. If it’s 3 or less, I’ll skip the bite and choose the cooling‑off or a gentle stretch instead. I’m a bit worried about eating, but I want to follow the plan and stay as flexible as I need to be."
