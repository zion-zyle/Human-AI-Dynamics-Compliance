    "agent_utterance": "Tonight in Suwon, try this ultra-simple approach: 1) drink a tall glass of water (about 250–300 ml) to refresh and curb thirst-driven urges. 2) take a 1-minute box breath: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. 3) if the craving remains after the breath, have one small bite from your pre-decided plan (for example, a few almonds or a small piece of fruit) and eat slowly. 4) after 25 minutes, do a quick craving check and rate the urge 1–10. If it’s still high, you can repeat a tiny bite or switch to a non-food coping strategy (brief walk, stretch, or tapping your breath). Be kind to yourself—you’re taking positive steps tonight.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here's a concise rationale: in hot, Monday Suwon weather and with the user’s high emotional sensitivity, a small, ultra-simple plan reduces friction and supports self-kindness. The recommended actions are hydration, brief breathing, and a tiny, pre-planned bite if cravings persist, followed by a short craving check.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that feels doable. I’ll start with water and the box breath, then I’ll take a tiny bite from my pre-approved list only if the craving sticks. I’ll check in after 25 minutes and rate my urge 1–10. If it’s still high, I’ll try a quick walk or stretch instead of eating. Keeping it simple and flexible helps because my schedule is irregular. Could we keep the bite very small (like a few almonds) and adjust timing to when I actually feel ready, not just on a clock?"

    "agent_utterance": "Excellent idea. Keep the bite tiny and delay eating until you feel genuinely ready. Tonight’s flexible plan:\n- Hydrate with about 250–300 ml of water and do 1 minute of box breathing.\n- Do a 2-minute urge scan, rating your urge on a 1–10 scale every 30 seconds.\n- If the urge is 6/10 or higher and you feel ready, have a tiny bite: 1–3 almonds (or a single small item from your pre-approved list). Eat slowly and savor.\n- If you don’t feel ready, or the urge remains high after 2 minutes, switch to a quick non-food strategy for 2–3 minutes (short walk, light stretch, or more deep breathing) and re-check.\n- After any bite, rate your urge again and decide whether to continue with non-food coping or end the session.\n- Tip: warm Suwon evening, stay hydrated, and keep the bite small to fit an irregular schedule.\nWould you like me to customize the almond count or wording to your exact bite list?",

    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that feels doable. I appreciate keeping this simple and flexible given my irregular schedule and tendency to be influenced by prompts. I’ll start tonight with water and box breathing, then do a quick urge check. If my urge is still high and I feel ready, I’ll have a tiny bite—no more than 1 almond or a single small item from my list and I’ll savor it slowly. If I don’t feel ready or the urge remains high after a couple minutes, I’ll switch to a quick non-food activity (short walk or stretch) and re-check. I’d like the plan to stay adjustable day to day instead of locking to a timer, so we can adapt as needed. Thanks for the support."
