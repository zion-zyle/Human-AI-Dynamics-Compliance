If anxiety rises, try a quick 30-second diaphragmatic breath (inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6). If finishing all four sips feels tough today, aim for at least 100 ml total and adjust tomorrow. Keep a bottle nearby and drink a little with meals to support hydration in this hot day.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: hot weather and Monday fatigue raise thirst and potential anxiety around drinking. You’ve already shown commitment to small, spaced hydration (four 50 ml sips with 15-minute reminders). I’ll keep the plan simple and low-pressure, include a quick breathing aid for anxiety, and acknowledge ED concerns by keeping portions small and adjustable.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the plan. I’m a bit anxious about increasing intake, but I want to give it a real try. I’ll start with the first 50 ml now and plan another 50 ml at 15 minutes. If I start to feel overwhelmed, I’ll pause and not force all four. My goal today is at least 100 ml total, and I’ll aim to build up tomorrow. It would help to have a quick reminder to sip with meals, and I’ll use a short diaphragmatic breathing check if anxiety spikes."

    "agent_utterance": "Nice work starting with 50 ml and planning a 15-minute check-in. For today, aim for at least 100 ml total and keep it flexible—you can stop there if you feel overwhelmed. Quick, practical cues you can use: - Meal reminder: try a small sip (30–60 ml) with upcoming meals to anchor hydration. If you skip a meal, sip with a snack or at another regular break. - Anxiety safety: if you feel anxious, pause the next sip and do a diaphragmatic breath: inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6; repeat 2 times or until you feel calmer. - Keep a bottle within reach and log your total intake so we can adjust tomorrow. You’re doing great—slow, steady progress beats forcing it today.",

    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the reminders. I’m glad for the structure, but I’m also anxious about increasing intake. I’m open to small, flexible steps.

For today, I’ll keep my plan with the first 50 ml now and a 15-minute check-in, and I’ll aim to add at least one meal-time sip if I can. I’ll log my total intake so we can adjust tomorrow.
