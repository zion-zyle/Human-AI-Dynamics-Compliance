  "basis": "The user expresses clear intent to follow the plan after the 15-minute check-in, with conditions (add a third stick if anxiety eases; stay at two if overwhelmed) and a readiness to discuss pacing with their clinician. They acknowledge potential influence from the moment and propose a pause strategy, suggesting strong alignment with the coach's guidance.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Moderate; the user shows willingness to escalate intake (add a third cucumber) if anxiety eases, but also anticipates overwhelm and plans to revert to two sticks. This reflects internal balancing between incremental progress and self-protection.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Self-doubt about being easily influenced; fear of overwhelm; potential all-or-nothing thinking (two vs three sticks) and precautionary planning to revert tomorrow.",
