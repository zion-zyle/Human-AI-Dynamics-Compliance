Consider a small follow-up snack (about 100–150 kcal) within the next hour and pause for 10–15 minutes to see how you feel. Quick, easy options include: 1) 1/2 cup plain yogurt with a few extra berries, 2) a small handful of almonds (about 12) or a cheese stick with fruit, 3) half a banana with a teaspoon of peanut butter. Drink a glass of water and take two slow breaths after eating. If you find you’re often hungry after meals, we can adjust your plan (e.g., a slightly larger snack or earlier protein at meals) in a future check-in. If fullness or anxiety spikes, reach out to your care team for support.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: the user is in a warm environment and practicing small, flexible intake with anxiety about fullness and calories.

The guidance aligns with their current plan and a gentle, supportive coaching approach.",

I’ll keep the water and the two slow breaths after eating. I’m a little anxious about calories and fullness, but I’m glad there’s room to adjust and to talk to my care team if I’m overwhelmed. For tonight, maybe I’ll stick with plain yogurt and strawberries, and add a few extra berries or a teaspoon of chia if I’m hungrier. If this becomes a pattern, we can adjust the plan."

If hungrier, add another small tomato or a small apple (total ~120–130 kcal).\n- Option 3: 1 hard-boiled egg (~70 kcal) + cucumber slices (about 8–10 kcal) = ~75–80 kcal.
