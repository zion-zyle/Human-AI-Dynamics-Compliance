    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll give that plan a try. Because my appetite is irregular, could we start with 100 ml of Option A instead of 150–200 ml? I’ll then do the 30-second box breathing and rate fullness and any discomfort on a 0–10 scale. If I’m still hungry after that, I can have a tiny snack (like yogurt or fruit) and check again. If I feel too full, dizzy, or anxious, I’ll pause and tell you how I’m feeling. I want to follow your guidance, but I need gentle, gradual steps and reassurance that I can adjust as needed."

After finishing, rate your fullness and any discomfort on a 0–10 scale. If you’re still hungry, have a tiny snack like yogurt or a small piece of fruit and reassess.

The plan includes immediate breathing guidance, monitoring, and optional small snacks to address irregular appetite while prioritizing safety and comfort.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that sounds like a gentle, doable plan. I’ll start with 100 ml Option A and do the 30‑second box breathing. My appetite is really irregular, so I appreciate that we’re taking it slow and can adjust as needed. If 100 ml doesn’t curb the hunger or if I still feel hungry afterward, is it okay to increase slightly or have a tiny snack? And if I start to feel too full, dizzy, or anxious, I’ll pause and tell you right away. I’ll rate fullness and discomfort after the breathing and let you know how I’m doing, especially on this Monday afternoon in Suwon."
