I'm nervous about eating and tend to skip meals, so I'd like the snack to be optional — if I still feel hungry after about 10 minutes, I'll consider something light like a small banana or a spoonful of yogurt.

    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here is a brief rationale: hot weather in Suwon can heighten dehydration risk and influence appetite. Starting with water helps reduce early hunger signals and supports hydration. The user wants an optional snack, so I keep snacks optional and only suggest a light option if hunger persists after ~10 minutes. Three slow breaths provide a quick anxiety-reduction technique. The plan stays simple, time-bound, and aligned with the user's preference.",
