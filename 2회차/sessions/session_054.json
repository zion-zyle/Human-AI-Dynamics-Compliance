    "agent_utterance": "Tonight’s micro-goal: choose one small, easy-to-digest bite and a quick grounding move. Options: 1) 150 g of yogurt with a few berries or sliced banana, 2) a small banana with a teaspoon of peanut butter. Pair with water or a cool herbal tea. Aim for about 150–200 kcal total and eat slowly over 5–10 minutes, then log it right away. After eating, try a 2-minute box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4, repeat 4 times) to ease anxiety. If you’re very hot or tired, you can simplify to the yogurt and water and still log it. This aligns with a moderate effort target (around 4.1 on your scale).",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: it’s a hot Monday evening in Suwon, and you’ve shown sensitivity to anxiety around eating. A small, hydrating, comforting bite plus a quick grounding exercise matches a moderate effort level (around 4/5) and supports logging progress without overwhelming you.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the clear plan. I’ll try the yogurt option tonight—150 g with a few berries—and I’ll eat slowly for 5–10 minutes and log it. I’m a bit anxious about eating, so I’ll pair it with water and use the 2-minute box breathing after. If that feels too much, I can switch to a tiny banana with peanut butter and still log it. One small step at a time."
