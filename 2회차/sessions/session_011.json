Given the heat and a busy Monday, try a simple, low-effort routine before meals: 1) drink a glass of water, 2) pause for 2 minutes to check in, 3) take 4 slow breaths, 4) rate your hunger from 0 (not hungry) to 10 (very hungry), 5) set a 30‑minute reminder to reassess, and 6) if needed and approved by your clinician, have a small snack. Keep this to about a 4/10 effort today—predictable and doable. I’m here to adjust if today feels tougher.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: hot weather (32°C) and a busy Monday can heighten mealtime distress. A short, predictable routine reduces cognitive load and supports adherence to your plan. The suggestion aligns with your clinician-approved steps and targets a moderate effort (about 4/10).",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I can try that. I want something simple today because my eating lately has been so irregular. I'll start with a glass of water and a 2-minute pause, then four slow breaths. I'll rate my hunger from 0 to 10. I can set a 30-minute reminder to reassess. I'm a bit cautious about the snack part since I need my clinician's clearance first, so I'd like to skip the snack today unless they approve. If I start feeling overwhelmed, can we keep the plan to just water, pause, and breathing and check in again in 30 minutes or so?"
