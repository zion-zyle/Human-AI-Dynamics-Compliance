    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my detailed internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: With hot 32°C weather on a Monday evening, a cool, light snack like cucumber with hummus is refreshing and easy to prepare.

    "user_utterance": "That cucumber and hummus idea sounds gentle and doable. I tend to skip meals, so I want to try it, but I’m anxious about fullness and calories. I’d like to start with a tiny portion—say 4–5 cucumber sticks with a thin layer of hummus—and do a 10-minute mindful pause, then check in in about 30 minutes.

In about 30 minutes, rate your hunger on a 0–10 scale and decide what you need next. If you’re at 0–3, you’re likely satisfied—you can finish there, or add one extra cucumber stick if it feels comfortable. If you’re at 4–6, consider a very small add-on (like one more cucumber stick or a teaspoon more hummus) to address hunger without overdoing it. If you’re at 7–10, you may want a more substantial option, and we can discuss a balanced next choice. Remember to stay hydrated in the heat. If anything feels off, we can adjust gradually together.",
