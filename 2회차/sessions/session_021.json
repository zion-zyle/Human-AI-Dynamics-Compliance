Here’s a simple plan and ready-to-use reminders to help you stay on track:\n\n1) 15-minute post-sip log (what to record):\n- Time: [fill in]\n- Fluid consumed: 20 ml\n- Anxiety (0-10): \n- Thirst level (0-10): \n- Any symptoms (dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, chest tightness, etc.):\n- Mood (0-10): \n- Trigger cues or thoughts:\n- Next step plan: If you feel okay, consider a very small sip around mealtime (e.g., 5-10 ml) or hold until you’re ready.\n\n2) Gentle reminder options (copy-paste and set in your device):\n- Hydration check-in (15 minutes from now): \n  Title/Label: Hydration check-in\n  Note: Log how you feel and how much you drank (20 ml). Rate anxiety and thirst (0-10). Mention any symptoms. If you’re feeling okay, consider a tiny sip around mealtime.\n\n- Mealtime reminder (before or around your usual mealtime):\n  Title/Label: Gentle sip at mealtime?\n  Note: If you feel well, take a very small sip (5-10 ml) with your meal.\n\n3) Quick setup tips: \n- iPhone: Open Reminders > New Reminder > paste one of the templates above > Set time for 15 minutes from now (and another for mealtime if you want).\n- Android/Google Calendar: Create an event for 15 minutes from now with the task “Hydration check-in” and another event near your mealtime with the note about a potential sip.\n- If you’d prefer, tell me your usual mealtime and your device (iPhone or Android) and I’ll tailor exact steps and wording.\n\nWould you like me to tailor the reminders to your exact mealtime and device? Also, when you check back in 15 minutes, you can paste your log here and I’ll help interpret how you’re feeling and adjust the plan if needed.",
