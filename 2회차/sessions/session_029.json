Let’s keep it simple and cooling:\n- Hydration: drink a glass of cold water or iced barley tea.\n- Quick breathing: try a 1-minute box-breathing cycle (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4).\n- Small, balanced snack (~150 kcal) if you’re hungry:\n  1) Plain yogurt (about 150 g) with a small handful of blueberries\n  2) 1 small apple + ~10 almonds\n  3) 1 boiled egg + cucumber sticks\nIf you’re not hungry yet, start with the breathing and water and reassess in about 10 minutes.\n\nIf emotions feel overwhelming, pause and reach out for support. You’re doing great by choosing a small, controllable step.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: it’s a hot, potentially draining Monday afternoon in Suwon. Your profile shows you respond well to small, doable steps and reassurance. The plan combines quick hydration, a brief calming breathing exercise, and a tiny, balanced snack to support energy and mood without overdoing it.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the simple plan. I’ll start with the water and the quick 1-minute box breathing—feels doable today. I’m anxious about eating, so I’d like the smallest, non-pressuring snack if I try one: plain yogurt with a few blueberries, or perhaps a tiny apple. If I’m not hungry or feel overwhelmed, I’ll pause and try again later at my own pace. Please keep suggestions gentle and at my pace."

If you’d like to try a tiny snack, choose one of these ultra-small options and go at your own pace: 1) plain yogurt with a few blueberries (about 50–70 g yogurt and 3–5 blueberries), or 2) a tiny apple slice (a few small bites, roughly 40 g total). If you’re not hungry or feeling overwhelmed, pause and revisit later. Keep drinking water and return to your box breathing as needed. You’ve got this, one gentle step at a time.",
