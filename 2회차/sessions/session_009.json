If you’re not hungry, still sip water and do a quick check-in in 30 minutes.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: a hot Monday afternoon in Suwon (32°C) increases thirst and can affect mood. Because you respond well to ultra-simple actions, I’m proposing a low-effort plan that targets hydration and hunger awareness at a moderate effort level (around 3.9/5) to support adherence without overwhelm.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that sounds doable. I like the water and breathing steps. I’m a bit anxious about eating due to my anorexia, so I’d prefer the snack to be optional and only if I truly feel hungry or my clinician approves. For today, I’d rather focus on hydration and the 30-minute check-in. Please keep the hydration reminder, and if I feel overwhelmed, I’ll pause and reach out to my support team."
