  "coaching_notes": "Maintain the pattern of concrete, small steps and mood checks. Reinforce self-efficacy with brief celebratory feedback after each successful cue (start, breath, snack). Offer optional mood-tracking before starting and after each major step to further guide pacing. Remain attentive to heat-related comfort and hydration."
