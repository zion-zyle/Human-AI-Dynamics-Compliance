Small, doable steps reduce overwhelm and support consistency.",

    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the plan. The water and the 10‑minute pause feel like a manageable start, and I’m willing to try the snack options you listed, though I’m anxious about eating. I’ll begin with the simplest choice—perhaps cucumber with hummus or yogurt with berries—and I’ll use the dinner plate guidance as a flexible scaffold, not a pressure. I’ll also set the 30‑minute reminder to check in with hunger versus fullness and to adjust without judgment. If I start to feel overwhelmed, I’d like to pause and talk through it with you first."
