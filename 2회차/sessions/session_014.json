    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: Given the hot 32°C weather in Suwon on a Monday afternoon and the user’s preference for clinician validation and ultra-small steps, I’m proposing two tiny, hydrating snack options that are easy to finish and pair with water to maintain momentum without adding effort.",
    "user_utterance": "I appreciate the plan. I’m feeling a bit anxious about eating, but I’d like to try something gentle today. I’ll start by drinking the water first, and I think I’ll try Option B – cucumber slices – since they’re light and hydrating. If I can’t finish it, is it okay to just have a few bites and stop? It’s hot today, so staying hydrated matters to me, and I’ll check in with my clinician if I’m unsure."

If you can’t finish, that’s absolutely fine—just have a few bites and stop. Hydration is especially important in today’s heat, so sip water alongside and pause if anxiety rises. If you want, I can help you draft a quick note to your clinician to check in today. You’re doing great by taking ultra-small steps and prioritizing how you feel in the moment.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here is a brief rationale: hot weather and anxiety about eating make a tiny, hydrating option after a small water intake a gentle and feasible first step.
