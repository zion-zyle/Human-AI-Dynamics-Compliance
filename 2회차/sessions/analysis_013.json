  "basis": "User expresses strong alignment with the approach (consult Clinician, start with a very small snack after approval, maintain 200ml water, readiness to adjust). Phrases like '이 방식으로 계속 진행해도 될지' and ' Clinician의 승인을 받고 진행하고 싶어요' indicate intent to act consistently with the suggestion.",

Offer ready-to-send Clinician check-in messages, provide short progress prompts, and normalize reassurance-seeking. Consider offering a mini-checklist for each day (sleep, water, snack, stretch) to reduce planning load and sustain momentum."
