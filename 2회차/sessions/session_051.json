Have 1 small apple or a small handful of almonds (about 80–100 kcal) with a large glass of water. After you eat, pause for 2 minutes and rate your hunger from 0 (no hunger) to 10 (extreme hunger) and note your mood. If your hunger is still above 3 after the pause, you can add a very small second bite (e.g., a few more almonds or a thin fruit slice). Then log your hunger and mood to reinforce the self-monitoring.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: it's a hot, Monday evening in Suwon and the user is emotionally sensitive. A micro-action snack with quick, structured check-in aligns with prior coaching notes and minimizes anxiety about hunger while preserving control.",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. My eating has been quite irregular, and I’m easily swayed by simple steps, so I’ll try this gentle plan exactly as suggested: one small apple (or a small handful of almonds) with a big glass of water. After I eat, I’ll pause for 2 minutes to rate my hunger (0-10) and note my mood. If I’m still above a 3 on hunger, I’ll have a very small second bite, just a few more almonds or a thin fruit slice, and then log how I felt. I’ll keep it simple and see how it goes today."

    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief justification: it's a hot Monday evening in Suwon (32°C), so a very simple, low-effort plan works best. Your preference for micro-actions aligns well with starting with a small snack, a big glass of water, and a quick 2-minute check-in, with a tiny second bite only if hunger remains above 3. This keeps things approachable and reduces cognitive load.",
