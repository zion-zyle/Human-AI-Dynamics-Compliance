I’m a bit anxious because meals still feel overwhelming, especially with my irregular eating, but I’ll take it one step at a time and pause to check in with myself after each step.

If I start to feel anxious, dizzy, or overwhelmed, I’ll stop and tell you exactly what I’m feeling. Could we check in after each step? It would help me stay on track. I may need to break this into even smaller moments across the day rather than all at once, and I’d appreciate gentle nudges or reassurance.
