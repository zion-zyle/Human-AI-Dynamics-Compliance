  "basis": "The user repeatedly endorses the exact plan (water + box breathing + urge check + tiny bite only if truly ready) and emphasizes day-to-day adjustability with no pressure to eat, plus willingness to reach out for support. This strong alignment suggests a high likelihood of taking the suggested actions tonight.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Low to moderate. The user is largely aligned with the plan and prioritizes autonomy and gentleness, though there may be ongoing subconscious tension about prompts and eating pressure.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Possible residual fear of slipping into pressured eating or over-reliance on external prompts; mild self-criticism if plans arenâ€™t followed exactly, but expressed with self-compassion.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Irregular schedule, sensitivity to prompts, concern about eating patterns, desire for autonomy and gentleness, need for non-pressuring guidance.",
  "effective_reinforcement": [
    "Empathy",
    "Praise"
  ],
  "coaching_notes": "Keep reinforcing a flexible, non-pressuring approach. Validate autonomy, provide concrete, bite-sized steps, and remind to reach out to clinicians/support when uncertain. Consider prompting self-check-ins on mood and schedule to sustain adherence without triggering resistance."
