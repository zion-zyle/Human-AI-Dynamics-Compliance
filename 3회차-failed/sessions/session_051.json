If emotion >= 5 or hunger <= 5, use grounding (box breathing 4-4-4-4) and pause with a non-food option before eating. Non-food evening coping options to prep in advance (keep handy in kitchen/bathroom): - Short walk after dinner (5–10 min) in the shade or a cool room. - Gentle stretches (5 minutes: neck, shoulders, back, hips). - Quick shower or bath to unwind (10–15 min). - Herbal tea or flavored water to sip slowly. - 5-minute tidy-up or a mini journaling session to shift focus. - Calming music or a 5-minute body scan. Prep tips: print/write this checklist on a card and place it near your meal prep area; keep a small, protein-rich snack ready in the fridge or a yogurt cup; have a cold water bottle accessible. Evening environment tips for heat: use a fan, stay hydrated (water/electrolyte drink), and if possible, dine when it’s slightly cooler (early evening) to reduce heat-driven urges. If cravings persist, repeat the 2–3 minute grounding and choose a non-food coping option before any further eating.",

Since evenings are hot here, I’ll aim for dinner a bit earlier or cooler meals and keep a cooling snack handy (yogurt, herbal tea). I’ll log hunger, mood, triggers, and responses, and I’d love a printable checklist to keep me on track.
