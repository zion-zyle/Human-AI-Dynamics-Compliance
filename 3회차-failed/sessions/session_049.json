Have 1 cup plain Greek yogurt (or plant-based yogurt) with 1/2 cup mixed berries, plus 1 tablespoon chia seeds or a small handful of almonds. Pair with a large glass of water or unsweetened iced tea. Eat slowly and log immediately after finishing. If cravings arise afterward, wait 10 minutes before deciding on more. Dairy-free option: swap to soy yogurt with berries and a few walnuts.",
    "agent_monologue": "Brief rationale: It's a hot Tuesday evening in Suwon (32°C). To reduce decision fatigue and support BED management, I’m proposing a small, cooling, balanced snack that's quick to prepare and easy to log. The plan emphasizes hydration, protein, and fiber to curb cravings while keeping portions modest.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable. I like the 300–350 kcal target and the yogurt-berry combo with chia seeds or a small handful of almonds. I’ll try 1 cup plain yogurt (or soy yogurt) with 1/2 cup berries and 1 tablespoon chia, or a few almonds, and pair it with a large glass of water. I’ll eat slowly and log right after finishing. If cravings show up, I’ll wait 10 minutes before deciding on more. I might swap to the dairy-free option on some days (soy yogurt with berries and walnuts). If I’m still hungry, could we adjust portions a bit or add more protein/fiber next time? I’ll aim to try this tonight."

    "agent_utterance": "Great plan. If you’re still hungry, here are quick, doable tweaks you can try next time (pick one if needed to avoid overdoing calories):\n\nOption A — Slightly larger yogurt: Increase to 1.25 cups plain or soy yogurt, keep 1/2 cup berries and 1 tablespoon chia. This adds roughly 60–100 kcal and boosts protein and fiber.\n\nOption B — Protein boost: Add 1 hard-boiled egg on the side, or mix in 2 tablespoons of nuts (almonds or walnuts) for about 70–100 kcal extra.\n\nOption C — Extra fiber from fruit: Add 1/2 cup more berries, or swap to a small apple or pear to increase fiber and fullness.\n\nDairy-free note: If you’re using soy yogurt, you can apply the same tweaks (e.g., 1.25 cups soy yogurt + 1/2 cup berries + 1 tablespoon chia; or add a hard-boiled egg if your plan allows, or a small handful of walnuts).\n\nIf you try one tweak tonight, log it and keep hydrating. If cravings return, you can re-commit with a similar, slightly adjusted option tomorrow.",
    "agent_monologue": "Sorry—I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: you asked how to adjust portions if you’re still hungry. In hot weather and around dinner time, simple, quick tweaks that boost satiety (protein and fiber) without a big calorie bump are most practical. Here are a few easy options you can use tonight or on future nights.",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. I’m thinking I’ll start with Option A tonight: 1.25 cups plain or soy yogurt, 1/2 cup berries, 1 tablespoon chia, plus a large glass of water. If I’m still hungry after, I’ll try Option B with a hard-boiled egg or a small handful of almonds, but I’ll log it right away and keep portions mindful. I’ll wait 10 minutes if cravings pop up.
