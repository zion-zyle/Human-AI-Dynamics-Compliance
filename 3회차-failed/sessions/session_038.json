Try this quick post-snack plan: 1) Do a 0–3 hunger check right after your snack. 0–1 = satisfied, 2–3 = still a bit hungry or tempted. 2) If 2–3, have a small protein bite (e.g., 150–200 g yogurt or 1 boiled egg) with a glass of water. 3) Log the snack and hunger score within 5 minutes. If you’re going to the gym later, have the light protein now and plan a proper dinner after. On hot days, choose a cool option and keep hydration up.",

I’ll do the 0–3 hunger check right after snacks and, if I’m at 2–3, grab a small protein bite with water and log it within 5 minutes.

Keep a glass of water handy. 2) Set a simple reminder to log: a phone alarm or calendar notification 5 minutes after you snack. 3) Lightweight plan for tougher days: predefine 1 extra backup snack and allow retroactive logging within the same day if you forget. 4) Weekends and social meals: aim for a protein-first plate when possible, pre-commit to logging after meals, and use non-judgmental substitutions for cravings. 5) Craving-management tips (non-judgmental): name the urge, try a 2-minute delay, take 1–2 minutes of slow breathing, hydrate, and choose a satisfying but controllable option (protein/fiber) when feasible.

    "agent_utterance": "Tonight and moving forward, here’s a compact, flexible plan tailored to BED and your context (Suwon, hot weather, Tuesday evening).\n\nTiny urge-management after snacks:\n- After snacks, name the urge (e.g., 'craving sweet', 'boredom'). Pause 2–5 minutes, breathe 4–6 slow breaths. Then choose a protein/fiber option or a grounding activity (water, short walk, quick stretch).\n\nPost-snack reflection:\n- Quick check: What went well? What could be improved? Log your hunger on a 0–3 scale and note any triggers.\n\nGentle post-binge routine:\n- If a binge occurs, pause, rinse your mouth, drink water, do a 2-minute grounding exercise, and jot one sentence about what would help next time. If feasible, plan the next protein-forward snack within 2–4 hours; avoid self-criticism.\n\nBackups and structure:\n- Backups after yogurt/egg: a handful of nuts (20–30 g) or 1 cheese stick with water.\n- Pre-logging cue: set a 5-minute post-snack reminder on your phone.\n\nTough days, weekends, and social meals:\n- Aim for a protein-forward plate whenever possible; pre-log after meals; have easy swaps ready (e.g., choose grilled fish or chicken, swap white rice for brown rice, keep kimchi/vegetables high in fiber).\n\nOne-week, food-specific plan (Korean grocery/typical foods):\n- Day 1 (tonight, Tue): Snack plan tonight: yogurt 150–200 g with berries or sliced fruit; backups: 20–30 g nuts or 1 cheese stick; water.\n- Day 2 (Wed): Breakfast: 2 boiled eggs + kimchi + small bowl of rice; Lunch: grilled mackerel or tofu with greens and brown rice; Snack: yogurt or edamame; Dinner: kimchi jjigae with tofu or grilled chicken and veggies.\n- Day 3 (Thu): Breakfast: Greek yogurt with sliced banana and walnuts; Lunch: tuna or salmon with greens and rice; Snack: cheese stick or almonds; Dinner: lean beef/pork bulgogi with veggies or tofu–mushroom stir-fry.\n- Day 4 (Fri): Breakfast: veggie omelet with a small portion of rice; Lunch: chicken breast or fish with kimchi and greens; Snack: yogurt or nuts; Dinner: seafood/tofu hot pot or steamed fish with vegetables.\n- Day 5 (Sat): Weekend structure: protein-forward meals; backup snack; plan a light activity post-meal; pre-log cue after meals.\n- Day 6 (Sun): Social meal day: pick a protein-first item at restaurants (grilled fish, chicken), fill half plate with veggies, small portion of rice; snack: edamame or fruit with a cheese stick; post-meal log.\n- Day 7 (Mon): Reset day: breakfast: yogurt or eggs; lunch: leftovers or quick stir-fry with tofu; snack: nuts; dinner: lean protein with veggies. End-of-day log and plan for next week.\n\nTips for cravings (non-judgmental): name the urge, delay a few minutes, breathe, hydrate, and then choose a protein/fiber option or a grounding activity. Hydration helps in heat—keep water handy.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor the exact portions and swaps to your typical groceries and meals—tell me a few groceries you always have and any foods you dislike.
