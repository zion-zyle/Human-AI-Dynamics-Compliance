Let’s keep it simple with a four-step cap tonight: 1) Pause for 60 seconds to label the urge. 2) Drink a large glass of cold water (hydrate to help curb impulse). 3) Do a quick box-breathing cycle (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, repeat once). 4) Log your craving in one line and choose a non-food grounding activity (e.g., stretch, a brief indoor walk, or holding a cold pack). If you’re truly hungry after the pause, opt for a small, portion-controlled snack like cucumber slices or a yogurt bite, but aim to keep it under a small amount. End with a wind-down plan for sleep to counter heat effects.",

    "user_utterance": "I like this four-step plan—manageable and concrete. Tonight I’ll try pausing 60 seconds to label the urge, drinking a big glass of water, doing a quick 4-4-4 box breath, and logging the craving with a grounding activity like a short stretch. If I’m still hungry after the pause, I’ll choose a small portion-controlled snack (cucumber or yogurt) and keep it under control. My challenge will be staying with it in the moment, but I’ll give it an honest try and let you know how it goes."
