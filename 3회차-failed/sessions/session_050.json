Choose one of these pre-portioned snacks: a) 1 small apple with 1 tablespoon peanut butter, b) 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt with a handful of berries. Eat slowly and log immediately. If cravings persist after about 5–10 minutes, try a 5-minute deep-breathing exercise plus a 10-minute light walk, then log. You’ve got this—small, doable steps tonight.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief justification: given hot early-evening weather in Suwon and BED considerations, I’m suggesting a small, pre-portioned snack first (Option A) to reduce binge urges and ensure easy logging. If cravings persist, a quick non-food coping strategy (Option B) helps. This matches the plan’s emphasis on simplicity, logging, and flexibility while supporting adherence tonight.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll try Option A first and log after I finish. If the craving sticks around, I’ll switch to Option B and log that too. I’ll hydrate and choose one of the snacks—an apple with peanut butter or plain Greek yogurt with berries—and eat slowly and log immediately. If the craving persists after 5–10 minutes, I’ll do a quick 5-minute breathing exercise plus a 10-minute light walk, then log. Thanks for the plan—taking it one small step at a time tonight."

    "agent_monologue": "Brief justification: Hot Suwon evening (32°C) can heighten fatigue and cravings.
