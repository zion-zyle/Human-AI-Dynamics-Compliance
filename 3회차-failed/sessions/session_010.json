    "agent_utterance": "Plan for a quick, hot-weather friendly anchor (about 4 minutes): 1) Drink 1 cup water and do 30 seconds of box breathing (inhale 4s, hold 2s, exhale 6s). 2) Do 2 minutes of light movement (short walk or gentle stretch). 3) Set a fixed 4:15 PM anchor: a 5-minute urge-check-in with a non-food coping option (cold splash, quick walk, or journaling); if still hungry, have a small pre-planned snack within the next 10 minutes (example: yogurt + berries). 4) Log the reminder and plan a brief weekly check-in. Keep hydration high and the actions simple and concrete to fit the warm weather.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: hot, afternoon timing can increase cravings and stress, especially with BED. A tiny, fixed action right after work is reliable, reduces decision fatigue, and aligns with your planned 4-minute-scale cue, making it easy to start now.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the clear plan. I like starting with water and a quick reset. With BED I’m a bit cautious about the 'small pre-planned snack' step—it can feel risky for me. If cravings persist after the non-food options, I’d prefer a very small, optional snack (like yogurt + berries) only after trying the urge-surf/non-food options for a few minutes. For step 2, two minutes of movement is doable, but on hot days I’d swap to a short stretch or a quick, shaded walk. The fixed 4:15 PM anchor is helpful, but my days vary; could we also have a flexible window (e.g., 4:00–5:00 PM) or a cue after meals? I’d also like a few more non-food coping options (breathing, cold splash, a one-minute grounding, quick journaling prompts) and a simple urge-surf journal prompt to log triggers and what helped. I’ll set reminders and plan a brief weekly check-in. Could we start with these adjustments?"

    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share an internal train of thought, but here’s a concise rationale: you asked for more flexible timing, extra non-food coping options, a cautious approach to snacks with BED, and options suited to hot weather. The plan below preserves structure while adding flexibility, expands coping tools, and keeps a gentle, stepwise urge-surf approach before any snack.",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds great—thanks for tailoring this to BED and hot weather. I’d like to start with these adjustments: - Anchor window: default to a flexible 4:00–5:00 PM window, with a cue after meals as an alternative trigger. - Coping options: keep the non-food options and add box breathing or 4-6-8, a cold splash, a one-minute grounding, and quick journaling prompts. - Urge-surf before snack: try urge-surf for 3–5 minutes first; if the urge persists, allow a very small snack only as a last resort. - Movement: 2 minutes is doable; on hot days I’ll swap to a short stretch or shaded walk. - Urge-surf journal: log what triggered the urge, what coping helped, and rate intensity 0–10; note what I’ll try next time. - Reminders and weekly check-in: yes, please set these. I’m ready to start today. Could we confirm these defaults, and would you prefer a ready-to-use journal template or prompts you can copy/paste?"
