    "agent_utterance": "Great question. I recommend rotating your backup snacks to keep things interesting while staying simple. Keep apple + peanut butter as your steady go-to, and rotate in the other backups every few days. A simple two-week pattern: Mon = apple + peanut butter; Tue = yogurt + berries; Wed = apple + peanut butter; Thu = air-popped popcorn; Fri = apple + peanut butter; Sat = yogurt + berries; Sun = apple + peanut butter. Then reassess. If you want even fewer decisions, you could mostly stick with apple + peanut butter and swap in yogurt + berries or popcorn a couple of times per week. Remember to hydrate and use your 1-minute breathing pause if stress spikes.",

Quick thought: should I tailor the rotation on days I know I’ll be more stressed or around social meals, or keep it mostly automatic?

Keep apple + peanut butter ready as well. \n- Set a 60-second check-in plus the 5-minute walk or cold-water cue on all days, with a heightened awareness on stress/social days. \n- Hydration remains a priority; pair each snack with a tall glass of water. \n- After the two-week pattern, reassess and adjust which backups feel easiest on the toughest days.\nYou’re doing great—this hybrid approach should help you stay in control without adding extra decision pressure.",

    "agent_utterance": "You’re doing really well—thanks for staying proactive. Here are concrete strategies for social meals and for adjusting the two-week pattern if stress stays high:\n\nSocial meals: how to avoid deprivation or a binge\n- Pre-plan portions: Decide in advance how you’ll handle the meal. For example, choose one sensible plate, followed by a backup snack if you still feel hungry after 15–20 minutes.\n- Bring or pre-prepare backups: On social days, have a small apple + peanut butter, yogurt + berries, or popcorn ready to go so you can nibble mindfully without overdoing the main dishes.\n- Eat first, then socialize: If you’re unsure about food availability, eat a small, balanced snack before you go to reduce impulse eating.\n- Plate smarter: Fill half your plate with veggies, a quarter with lean protein, and a quarter with healthy carbs. Eat slowly, pausing between bites and sipping water.\n- Pace yourself: Take 20–30 minutes for the meal. Put your utensils down between bites and check in with your hunger cues.\n- Mindful indulgences: If you want dessert or a special treat, choose a single portion and savor it slowly rather than grazing.\n- Hydration and beverages: Alternate water with non-sweet drinks. Avoid large amounts of alcohol or sugary beverages that can spike appetite.\n- Communicate graciously: If appropriate, you can explain you’re aiming to stay on track, which often reduces pressure and keeps you accountable without feeling deprived.\n- After-meal plan: A 5– to 10-minute walk or a short breathing pause can help reset appetite after the meal.\n\nTweak the two-week pattern if stress stays high\n- Add a “stress-day” tier: Keep your default Apple + Peanut Butter, but designate certain days as flexible backups (e.g., Yogurt + Berries or Popcorn) to pre-empt decision fatigue on high-stress days.\n- Increase prep and automation: On weeks with higher anticipated stress, prep two backups per day (e.g., both Yogurt + Berries and Popcorn ready) and use calendar reminders to switch automatically.\n- Shorten decision windows: Instead of thinking about a two-week rotation, use a rolling 7- to 10-day window that emphasizes reliability and minimal decision-making on busy days.\n- Add a lightweight safety net: If stress remains high across several days, allow one small planned treat (within your backups) so you don’t feel deprived, then return to the structure.\n- Reassess cadence: After 2–3 weeks of sustained high stress, review which backups felt easiest, which times of day were hardest, and adjust the rotation and prep accordingly.\n\nGeneral tips\n- Keep the 60-second check-in and the quick coping steps (5-minute walk, breathing pause) as defaults for every day.\n- Use reminders and pre-portion foods the night before to reduce friction in the moment.\n- If you miss a day, reset tomorrow without guilt; consistency over perfection matters more in the long run.\n\nYou’ve built a solid, controllable plan that respects both social needs and your health goals. If you want, tell me roughly how many social meals you expect per week, and I’ll tailor a more specific rotation and prep list for those days.\n\nYou’re making strong progress—keep trusting the process, and adjust as you learn what works best for you.",

Here are concise, actionable answers you can use right away:\n\n1) Social meals — simple rule\n- Use: one sensible plate plus a backup snack only if you’re still hungry after 15–20 minutes.\n- Prepped backups to choose from (and keep handy): Apple + Peanut Butter, Yogurt + Berries, or Air-Popped Popcorn.\n- How to do: eat slowly, pause between bites, hydrate, and check hunger cues at 15–20 minutes. If hunger persists, take a small backup portion; if not, enjoy the social meal without pressure.\n\n2) If stress stays high — rotation or extra backups\n- Switch to a rolling 7–10 day pattern to reduce decision fatigue.\n- Keep Apple + PB as default and have two backups prepped on stress days (e.g., Yogurt + Berries and Popcorn) so you can rotate without thinking much.\n- Use calendar reminders to auto-switch on stress days.\n- Consider allowing one small planned treat on persistently stressful days to prevent deprivation; reassess after 1–2 weeks.\n\n3) Craving/trigger log — helpful?\n- Yes. Start a light log: date/time, trigger (e.g., stress, social cue, heat), craving intensity 0–10, snack chosen, outcome (felt better, still craving, etc.).\n- Review every 3–7 days and adjust backups or triggers accordingly.\n\n4) Staying automatic while traveling or at big gatherings\n- Pack a small snack kit (mini portions of your backups) and keep portions ready.\n- Pre-plan: choose your default snack first when ordering, and identify a sensible plate if you’re at a buffet or shared table.\n- Maintain the basics: 60‑second check-in, quick walk or breathing pause, and hydration.\n- Set reminders and use pre-scheduled switches even when out of routine.\n- Allow flexibility for social enjoyment, but return to your plan promptly after events.\n\nOverall: you’re building a reliable framework that reduces decision fatigue, supports your BED goals, and adapts to travel and social contexts.

Treat the urge as a temporary wave that will pass. 4) Reinforce your plan by reminding yourself you’ll wait to eat until your next scheduled backup if you’re not truly hungry. Weekly progress check-in: Yes—keep it simple. On a chosen day (e.g., Sunday), answer: (a) how many days you followed the default plan, (b) craving intensity 0–10 and triggers, (c) what helped this week, (d) what you’ll adjust next week.
