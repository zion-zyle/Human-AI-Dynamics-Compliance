If cravings spike, pause for 2 minutes, take a few slow breaths, and ask whether you’re truly hungry. After logging, a short 10-minute walk or light stretch can help you wind down.

    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable tonight. A 150–200 kcal protein snack is a good target for me. I like Greek yogurt with berries or a boiled egg with cucumber, and I’ll drink water with it. I’ll try the 2-minute urge pause and slow breathing if cravings spike, then log what I eat. A 10-minute walk or light stretch after sounds like a nice wind-down. When I’m dining out, I’ll put protein and veggies first and keep portions moderate. I might prep a couple extra options (like cottage cheese with tomato) in case yogurt isn’t available. If I’m really craving, I’ll ask myself: am I truly hungry or is it a mood/urge? Thanks—I'll aim to start tonight and we can review on Day 3 and adjust."

If the urge persists, I’ll switch to an alternative activity and log what happened. Could we also build in a simple early-warning sign checklist for Day 3?

A couple quick questions: if the urge is very strong, should I shorten the delay or jump straight to the non-food activity? on social nights, any tips to keep logging easy? and if I’m pressed for time, could a brief 5–10 minute walk count as the wind-down?

Quick answers to your questions: 1) Very strong urge: jump straight to a non-food activity after a brief grounding (~30 seconds) and keep the activity going for at least 5 minutes; log after the activity or when you feel ready. 2) Logging on social nights: pre-fill a simple log template before you go, use a one-tap or voice-note log, log immediately after eating, set a short reminder, and consider a logging buddy to check in. 3) If time is tight: yes, a 5–10 minute walk counts as wind-down; if that isn’t possible, do a 2–3 minute grounding plus a quick stretch or breathing cycle and log when you can.
