If a craving returns, repeat a 2–3 minute quick coping action (breathing, sip water, or another short walk).",

    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable today. I'll start by hydrating with a large glass of water, then have a small protein-rich snack (yogurt or almonds with fruit) if I’m hungry.

If cravings pop up again, I’ll try a quick 2–3 minute coping action like breathing or another short walk.

I’d also love a few extra quick options to choose from (2-minute grounding, 5-minute box breathing, a short 4–5 minute walk, or a tiny stretch) so I’m not stuck deciding last minute.
