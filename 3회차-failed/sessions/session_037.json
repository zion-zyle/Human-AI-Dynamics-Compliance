    "agent_monologue": "I'm unable to share my full internal reasoning step-by-step. Brief summary: hot weather and BED sensitivity push me to a very simple, privacy-friendly plan that requires minimal effort. The key factors I considered are heat comfort, hunger vs urge cues, and the need for quick, loggable actions to stay on track.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan sounds doable tonight. It’s hot here in Suwon, so I’ll start with a tall glass of water and a quick 60-second breath check to calm urges. I like the high-protein snack idea and will probably choose plain yogurt with berries or a cheese stick with an apple. I’ll log the snack in the app right away and note how hungry I am and how my mood feels. If I’m outside, I’ll move indoors to shade or AC and do a few slow breaths. If the urge sticks around, I’ll repeat the grounding breaths and keep it simple rather than binge."
