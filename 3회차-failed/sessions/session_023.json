    "user_utterance": "Thank you—this plan feels doable. I like the 60-second check-in and urge surfing, and the idea of a short walk after dinner. A couple tweaks would help: I often forget to log urges, so could we add a quick reminder cue? I also tend to crash in the afternoon (around 3–4 pm) with strong cravings, so a small, balanced snack then might help. For hydration, I’ll try carrying a bottle and sipping regularly instead of waiting to hit a specific 250 ml target. If it’s hot or dinner is late, I’ll adapt the walk to inside or in shade. Could we add a simple fallback for social meals or busy days? I’ll try this today and report back so we can adjust tomorrow."

Here’s a concise, doable today plan that fits your context and tweaks: 1) Urge logging cue: set a daily 3:00 PM reminder (phone notification or calendar alert) and log with one tap: Urge present? Yes/No; If Yes, note your chosen action (log/urge-surf). 2) Afternoon snack (3–4 PM): pick one 150–200 kcal option to blunt crash, e.g. apple + 1 tbsp peanut butter, 150 g yogurt with berries, or a small handful of almonds (14–20) with a piece of fruit. 3) Hydration: carry a bottle and sip regularly; aim to finish by dinner. In heat, consider a light electrolyte drink if you’re sweating a lot. 4) Post-dinner activity: if it’s hot or late, do a 5–10 minute walk in shade or a quick indoor stretch to shift energy. 5) Social meals / busy days fallback: before meals or events, set a simple plan like: start with vegetables, keep portions reasonable, pause before seconds, and log afterwards if you can. Use urge surfing during cravings. 6) Tonight’s quick logging: jot a single line like: “Urge: X; Action taken: Y; How I felt: Z.” Share what happened tonight and I’ll adjust tomorrow.",
