Quick non-food coping ideas for evenings: - Do a 3-minute cooling breath: inhale for 4 counts, exhale for 6 counts, repeat 3–5 times, and name 5 things you see to ground yourself. - Hydrate and cool down: sip cold water or peppermint tea, and splash a little cold water on your face. - Move for 5 minutes: gentle stretch or a short hallway walk to shift cravings. - Establish a calm wind-down: a brief 5-minute body scan or journaling, then dim lights and unplug screens 30 minutes before bed.",

A couple of additions would help on tougher nights: Urge journaling prompts I can use tonight include: 1) What physical hunger am I really feeling right now—am I hungry or seeking comfort? 2) What emotion or situation is driving the urge? 3) What small, kind action could I try instead of eating? 4) If I do snack, what portion would truly meet hunger and how will I pause afterward?
