    "agent_utterance": "Yes—almond butter works well as a substitute for peanut butter in the same serving size (about 1 tablespoon, 16–18 g). Calories are similar (roughly 90–110 kcal, depending on brand). Choose unsweetened, minimally salted almond butter if you can. You can use it with your apple just like peanut butter, or swap in a yogurt or rice cake if you’re short on peanut butter. For backups, keep a small low-cal snack ready and do a quick 3–5 minute breathing/grounding exercise. For the hunger check timer, try an 8–10 minute pause: rate your hunger on a 0–10 scale, note thirst and mood, and decide whether you still need a snack or can wait. With hot weather, continue hydrating and enjoy a simple, mindful check-in.",

    "agent_utterance": "Here are quick tips to distinguish true hunger from urge-driven cravings: 1) Use a hunger scale (0–10). True physical hunger tends to rise gradually over 10–20 minutes and is linked to physical signs (stomach growling, lightheadedness, low energy). Cravings often come on suddenly and are highly specific to a food. 2) Pause and hydrate: drink a glass of water or herbal tea and wait 5–10 minutes. 3) Re-check hunger after the pause. If it remains high (roughly 4–6 or higher) and you’re due for a meal or snack, consider your planned option (aim for protein + fiber). 4) Check for triggers: note whether you’re bored, stressed, tired, or hot. Do a quick grounding exercise or a short walk to reset. 5) Differentiate thirst from hunger: thirst can feel dry or fatigued; hydrate first. 6) Practice urge surfing: observe the craving for 5–10 minutes without acting; use a few calm breaths (box or 4-4-4-4). 7) Plan regular meals with protein and fiber to reduce urges, and in hot weather prioritize hydration and cooling to support better signals.",
