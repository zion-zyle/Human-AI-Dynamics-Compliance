    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the plan. I like the grounding options and the emphasis on non-food distractions. Tonight I’ll try 5-4-3-2-1 breathing, then drink a big glass of water and do a quick stretch or a 1–2 minute walk outside. I’ll aim for the 10–15 minute urge delay and log it. I’m a bit wary of the fridge-logging and pre-portioned snacks idea—could we keep snacks simple/optional and focus more on non-food coping (tea, journaling, a short chore) for now? I often get stronger cravings in the evening, so could we tailor the plan for late-day urges and maybe extend the delay if needed? Also please remind me to stay hydrated in this heat. If the urge doesn’t fade after the delay, what should be my next step?"

    "agent_utterance": "Great plan. Here’s a late-day tailored approach, keeping snacks optional and emphasizing non-food coping:\n\n- Your immediate steps tonight: 1) 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, 2) drink a big glass of water, 3) do a quick stretch or a 1–2 minute walk outside.\n\n- Snacks: keep them simple and optional. If you want something small, choose one of these only: a small piece of fruit or a cup of tea. The emphasis stays on non-food coping first.\n\n- Late-day delay plan (evening-focused): start with a 15-minute urge delay. If the craving remains, extend to a total of 25–30 minutes. After each delay, try 1–2 non-food coping actions such as:\n  • Journaling for 3–5 minutes\n  • A short chore (e.g., load dishwasher, wipe a counter)\n  • A brief movement break or stretch\n\n- Hydration in the heat: have a large glass of water now and aim for another 250–500 ml during the delay window. If you’re sweating a lot, consider a light electrolyte drink.\n\n- If the urge doesn’t fade after the delay: do a second delay cycle (another 10–15 minutes) and/or change your environment (cooler room, shade, or step outside briefly). If it’s still strong after two cycles, log the urge and reach out to a support person or plan a longer non-food activity (15–30 minutes) before deciding on eating.\n\n- Logging: continue with your log to note time, urge level, coping used, and outcome.\n\nHydration reminder stays in place—stay cool and hydrated tonight.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private internal chain-of-thought, but here is a concise, high-level rationale: late-day urges often intensify in warm conditions, so the plan centers on easy, non-food coping and keeps snacks optional. We tailor the delay to evening timing by starting with a 15-minute window and allowing an extended window up to 25–30 minutes if needed. Hydration is emphasized due to heat. If the urge persists after the delay, the next step is another brief delay cycle with additional non-food coping or a quick environmental change, followed by logging and, if needed, support outreach.",

Here are concise answers aligned with tonight’s plan:\n\n1) If the urge hasn’t faded after the second delay (10–15 minutes): should I keep delaying in blocks or switch to a longer non-food activity first?\n- Practical rule: if the craving remains strong after the second 10–15 minute delay, switch to a longer non-food activity (15–30 minutes) first and log it. If the craving feels more moderate, you can try one more short delay (another 10–15 minutes) before switching. In short: use a longer non-food activity first when cravings feel high, otherwise add another short delay.\n\n2) For extra support before tomorrow, is replying here enough, or would a short daily prompt help me stay on track?\n- Both options work. Replying here is fine for quick updates. If you’d like more structure, I can provide a brief daily prompt (e.g., three quick questions each morning) and you can opt to receive it as a recurring reminder. Tell me which you prefer, and I’ll tailor it.\n\n3) Any tips for extending delays beyond 30 minutes on evenings when cravings are strongest, given BED?\n- Try these strategies:\n  - Urge surfing: name the urge, observe it, and ride it without acting; label it as temporary and bring attention to the next small action you’ll take.\n  - Break into micro-delays: 5–10 minute mini-delays, then reassess. Build to 40–60 minutes by adding short, meaningful non-food activities in 5–10 minute chunks.\n  - Prioritize non-food activities that you can sustain: journaling prompts, a longer chore, a longer stretch, or a brief outside walk. Have a go-to list you can rotate.\n  - Environment and ritual: keep your cooler room, stay hydrated, and add a quick cue (a glass of water with a mint, a cold towel) to shift focus.\n  - Nutrition balance: ensure you’re not hungry at night—adequate protein/fiber at meals can reduce late cravings; don’t skip meals.\n  - Sleep and heat management: cooler sleep environment and hydration reduce nighttime cravings tied to fatigue and heat.\n  - After a successful longer delay, reward yourself with a non-food treat and log it to reinforce the behavior.\n  - If cravings feel overwhelming, consider reaching out to a support person earlier in the evening.\n\nNote: With BED, consistency in meals, hydration, and sleep, plus gradual extension of delays, tends to improve long-term outcomes. You’re already doing great by planning and logging.\n\nIf you want, I can set up a quick 9:00 AM check-in tomorrow with three questions you can answer in one message. And about the daily prompt, just say yes and I’ll include a simple three-question prompt in our daily check-ins.\n\nStay cool, hydrate well, and keep logging tonight. I’m here to support you.",
