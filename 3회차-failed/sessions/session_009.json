Optional: a 5-minute evening check-in to review what helped today. This plan aims for about 4/5 adherence by staying simple, flexible, and doable in today’s heat.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private chain-of-thought, but here is a concise rationale: today’s hot Suwon afternoon increases urge risk for BED. A brief, low-effort plan with hydration, a quick urge log, and flexible snack/portion rules helps you stay aligned without overthinking.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the simple plan — I like that it’s doable, especially in this heat. I have a few thoughts to fit my BED and my day-to-day:\n- Hydration: I’ll start with 500 ml, but I often forget in the afternoon. Could we add a quick reminder at work and after workouts?\n- Urge log: The 2-minute impulse log sounds doable. I’ll rate craving 0–10, write down the trigger, and bring it to our check-in.\n- Coping options: If the urge is 5 or higher, I’m open to a BED-friendly snack or a 10-minute delay with a short breathing exercise. I worry snacks can spiral, so maybe we also add a tiny check: “Is this something I’d choose even if I weren’t craving?”\n- Social/travel plate: I appreciate the plate guidance. When I’m with others I can aim for half the plate vegetables, a palm-sized portion of protein, and a small portion of starch or fruit. Some days it still feels hard in the moment—could we plan ahead for events with a quick Go-To option and a portion plan?\n- My adherence lately has been mixed; some days I follow the steps, others not. I want to build consistency gradually. Would you suggest a simpler version for rough days (e.g., just the log and one coping option) or a tiny daily check-in?\n\nHappy to try a tiny first tweak if you think it will help me stay on track with triggers like afternoon slump and stress. What would you recommend as my first adjustment?"

    "agent_utterance": "First adjustment to try: add two simple reminders to your day.\n\n1) Afternoon hydration/urge-log reminder: pick a consistent window in the afternoon (for example 2:30–3:00 pm). Message: “Hydrate 500 ml and log your urge (0–10) with the trigger.”\n\n2) Post-workout urge-check reminder: within 15–30 minutes after you finish a workout. Message: “Log urge (0–10), note trigger, and pick one coping option (BED-friendly snack or 10-minute delay with breathing).”\n\nImplementation tips:\n- Use your phone’s reminders, calendar alerts, or a habit-tracking app.\n- If you’re unsure about exact times, schedule them around your typical slump and after workouts and adjust as needed.\n- Keep the coping option simple: urge log + one coping choice only (no extra steps) for rough days.\n\nThis first tweak should help you stay on track on busy or hot days while you build consistency.",

    "user_utterance": "That sounds good, I like the reminders idea. A couple tweaks to fit BED and my day: - Afternoon reminder: keep it in a 2:30–3:00 pm window with: Hydrate 500 ml and log your urge (0–10) with trigger, and allow one quick snooze if I miss it. - Post-workout reminder: 15–30 minutes after finishing. Log urge, note trigger, and pick one coping option. Add a tiny check: would I choose this snack even if I weren’t craving? If no, try a nonfood coping or postpone. - On rough days, keep it to log plus one coping option only to build consistency. - Optional Go-To event plan for meals (half plate vegetables, palm of protein, small starch/fruit) can come later. Before you set this up, would you tailor the reminder times to my actual schedule or keep these windows?

    "user_utterance": "Yes—let's tailor the reminders to my actual schedule and set them up now. My typical day: I usually finish work around 5:30 pm and I tend to work out around 6:30–7:15 pm, with an afternoon slump around 2:45–3:15 pm. I’m comfortable keeping the afternoon window at 2:30–3:00 pm if that stays consistent, and the post‑workout reminder 15–30 minutes after finishing (roughly 7:00–7:45 pm in my current pattern). Please configure these two anchors now. For the Go‑To event plan, let’s save that for the next tweak so I can ease into it. If you want a tiny starter you can drop in later, we could add a simple nonfood coping option as part of the Go‑To plan.

That would keep it aligned when end times drift. I’m glad the Go-To plan is saved for the next tweak, and I’m okay adding a tiny nonfood coping option later (like 60 seconds of box breathing or a quick 5‑minute walk) to keep things simple on rough days.
