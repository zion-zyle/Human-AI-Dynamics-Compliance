For your 7:30–8:00 PM snack, choose one of these easy, protein-rich options and pre-portion them:\n- Option A: Plain Greek yogurt (about 150–170 g) with a small handful of berries.\n- Option B: A small handful (about 15–20) almonds.\n\nAim for roughly 150–200 calories total. Keep the portions ready in the fridge or a small bag ready to grab.\n\nIf a craving hits, pause for 2 slow breaths and go with the pre-planned portion instead of grazing.\n\nAt bedtime, complete your 4-field nightly log:\n- Hunger (0–10)\n- Trigger (what prompted the urge)\n- Action (snack or alternative)\n- Satisfaction (0–10)\n\nHydration & wind-down: sip water or unsweetened iced tea and consider a quick 2-minute wind-down to finish the evening calmly, especially in the warm 32°C weather today in Suwon.",

If cravings feel stronger tonight, try this practical escalation ladder: 1) Quick non-food pause: take 2 slow breaths, then do a 2–3 minute grounding activity (e.g., gentle stretching, a short walk around the room, or a quick tidy-up). 2) Tiny non-food distractions: sip cold water or unsweetened tea, rinse your mouth, chew sugar-free gum, brush your teeth, or hold an ice cube for a minute. 3) Time-delayed check: postpone the snack by 10–15 minutes and repeat a quick 1–2 minute grounding exercise; often urges fade with time. 4) Portion adjustment within plan: if the craving remains intense, consider splitting the pre-planned portion into two small portions 10–15 minutes apart (both within your 150–200 kcal target) or slightly reframe the snack (e.g., yogurt with a bit more protein/fiber within your calories). 5) Environment & accountability: move away from the kitchen, set a visible reminder for the 4-field log, and text a friend or coach if you’re feeling overwhelmed. 6) Aftercare: hydrate, do a 2-minute wind-down, and review your Hunger/Trigger/Action/Satisfaction log before bed with self-compassion. If cravings persist despite these steps, you can choose to delay the snack and shift the plan to your next meal.",
