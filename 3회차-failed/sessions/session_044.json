    "agent_utterance": "Here's a concrete, privacy-first wiring plan you can follow tonight. Pick one tool approach that fits your workflow:\n\nOption 1 — Local JSON template + simple auto-fill script (recommended for true on-device use)\n- Field mappings you’ll implement in your script/template:\n  - entry_id\n  - date\n  - time\n  - location\n  - plan_defaults: { water_ml, nasal_seconds, grounding_minutes }\n  - snack_option: { type, yogurt_portion, berries_portion, almonds_portion, fruit_option }\n  - craving_before\n  - craving_after\n  - mood\n  - hunger\n  - log_complete\n  - check_in: { scheduled_time, prompts_used }\n  - privacy: { storage, backup_opt_in }\n  - data_store\n\n- Tonight’s defaults to auto-fill: date: today, time: current, location: Suwon-si, South Korea, plan_defaults: { water_ml: 250, nasal_seconds: 60, grounding_minutes: 3 }, snack_option: { type: \"yogurt_berries_nuts\", yogurt_portion: \"1/2 cup\", berries_portion: \"1/2 cup\", almonds_portion: \"12-15\" }\n- Check-in: scheduled_time: 21:00, prompts_used: [craving, mood, hunger] (optional)\n- Backups: set backup_opt_in to true only if you want to back up later; store backups encrypted on local drive or another trusted local path. Default remains storage: on-device, with backup_opt_in: false.\n- Skipping check-in: you can leave check_in fields blank or prompts_used empty; the log flow remains intact.\n\nOption 2 — Google Sheets (offline-capable) template (good if you want a simple spreadsheet)\n- Field mappings (column headers): entry_id, date, time, location, water_ml, nasal_seconds, grounding_minutes, snack_type, yogurt_portion, berries_portion, almonds_portion, fruit_option, craving_before, craving_after, mood, hunger, log_complete, check_in_time, prompts_used, privacy_storage, backup_opt_in, data_store\n- Tonight’s defaults to fill into the sheet: water_ml 250, nasal_seconds 60, grounding_minutes 3, snack_type yogurt_berries_nuts with yogurt_portion 1/2 cup, berries_portion 1/2 cup, almonds_portion 12-15, check_in_time 21:00 (or blank if you’ll decide later)\n- Backups: cloud sync can be disabled by turning off offline/cloud sync; when ready, enable backup_opt_in and choose a secure backup location. For privacy, keep the sheet private and delete or restrict access as needed.\n- Skipping check-in: simply leave the check_in_time and prompts_used cells blank.\n\nOption 3 — Lightweight local-notes app (Obsidian, Bear, or similar) with a simple local template\n- Use a local template document containing the fields above in a structured block (YAML or JSON-like snippet) and auto-fill tonight’s defaults with a small script or manual paste. Keep the document in a local folder with on-device storage and optional export for backup.\n\nHelpful tips for wiring up tonight:\n- Use tonight’s defaults exactly as stated: water 250 ml, nasal 60 seconds, grounding 3 minutes, snack as yogurt/berries/nuts or fruit/nuts.\n- Nightly check-in window: 9:00 PM local time or 30–60 minutes after your snack if needed; prompts can be optional or omitted on busy nights.\n- If you want an auto-fill script, I can provide a starter snippet in Python or JavaScript that outputs the payload in your chosen format (JSON for Option 1, CSV for Option 2).\n- Data privacy: keep storage_local by default; backup_opt_in = true enables your chosen backup path. Use encrypted backups if possible. Do not turn on cloud syncing unless you explicitly opt in.\n- Tonight’s dry-run payload example (tonight’s defaults):\n  date: 2025-09-30\n  time: 18:30\n  location: Suwon-si, South Korea\n  plan_defaults: { water_ml: 250, nasal_seconds: 60, grounding_minutes: 3 }\n  snack_option: { type: \"yogurt_berries_nuts\", yogurt_portion: \"1/2 cup\", berries_portion: \"1/2 cup\", almonds_portion: \"12-15\" }\n  craving_before: 6\n  craving_after: 2\n  mood: calm\n  hunger: 3\n  log_complete: true\n  check_in: { scheduled_time: 21:00, prompts_used: [craving, mood, hunger] }\n  privacy: { storage: \"on-device\", backup_opt_in: false }\n  data_store: \"local_only\"\n\nIf you share which tool you want to use (Option 1, 2, or 3), I’ll tailor exact field names and provide a copy-paste-ready template or a tiny script to auto-fill from your defaults.
