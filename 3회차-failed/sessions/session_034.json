    "agent_utterance": "Great plan. Tonight's actionable steps: 1) Before any eating, wait 15 minutes (extend to 25–30 if cravings persist). 2) Do a quick 5-minute stretch. 3) Drink a large glass of water (add a splash of electrolyte if helpful). 4) Rate your urge 1–10 and jot a one-line feeling note. If the urge fades (1–3), proceed with a light meal or snack only if you are truly hungry. If the urge remains high (4+ after the delay), choose a small, pre-portioned healthy snack (e.g., 15–20 g nuts, a small yogurt, or a piece of fruit) and keep portions in check. 5) Do a calm activity instead of pantry browsing (breathing for 5 minutes, a short walk, or a cold splash). 6) Keep your room cool and quiet. 7) 9:00 PM check-in to reflect on today. Hydration is key in the heat today in Suwon, so aim for consistent fluids through the evening.",
