Tonight: 1) do a 2-minute urge-and-mood log—note what you ate today (or plan to), any cravings, and any triggers. This helps you spot patterns without overthinking. 2) pick one easy morning action for tomorrow (under 10 minutes): a 5-minute gentle stretch plus a protein-rich breakfast (like yogurt with berries), or a quick 5-minute indoor walk if you feel up to it. If cravings come up tonight, try 60 seconds of box breathing and sip cold water or iced tea. I can also send you a fillable log sheet (PDF or Google Sheet)—which format would you prefer?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my detailed internal monologue, but here’s a concise rationale: the hot evening and BED risk favor a very short, indoor, low-effort action with quick logging to anchor tomorrow’s routine.

    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable. Tonight I'll try the 2-minute urge-and-mood log to map triggers without overthinking. For tomorrow I'll commit to one quick morning action: a 5-minute stretch plus a protein-rich breakfast (like yogurt with berries or eggs). If cravings flare tonight, I'll do 60 seconds of box breathing and sip water. I tend to forget to log, so could we set a reminder? I also like a fillable log, preferably a Google Sheet for easy on-my-phone use. If that's not possible, a printable PDF backup would be great."

Set notifications to alert at the time.\n- If you prefer phone reminders, use your preferred app (Kakao, Samsung/Android reminders) with the same times and a quick message: \"Log your urge/mood\" and \"Stretch + breakfast\".\n\nFillable log template:\n- Use this CSV template to import into Google Sheets (copy-paste or upload):\nDate,Day,Time,UrgeLogged,CravingLevel,Triggers,Mood,FoodLogged,BreakfastPlan,StretchDone,Notes\n\nOptional: A Google Sheet shareable template\n- If you share your Google account email, I can draft and share a ready-to-use Google Sheet with dropdowns and data validation (UrgeLogged: Yes/No; CravingLevel: 0-10; etc.)\n\nPrintable PDF backup:\n- I can provide a one-page printable PDF with the same fields if you’d like.
