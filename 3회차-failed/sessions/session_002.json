If emotional, skip unplanned overeating and choose a small, planned snack instead: a) 1 small yogurt with a few berries, or b) 1 small apple with 1 tablespoon peanut butter. 3) Take a 3-minute cooling break in a cool spot and take 4 slow breaths. 4) Log one sentence about urges and what you chose. 5) If urges persist, pause and switch to a 5-minute journaling prompt or a quick activity (stretch, short walk, or shower) to shift focus.",
