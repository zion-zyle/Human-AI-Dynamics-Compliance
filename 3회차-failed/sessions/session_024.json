For example, 1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt with 1/2 cup blueberries, plus a full glass of water. If you’re dairy-free, choose 1/2 cup unsweetened almond yogurt with berries. After you snack, take a 1–2 minute mindful pause (quick box breathing: inhale 4, exhale 6) and log tonight’s snack. Optional: a 10-minute light walk after dinner to support fullness cues and mood.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: it’s a hot late-afternoon in Suwon (32°C), which can heighten cravings and fatigue, and the user has BED. The plan should be ultra-simple, portable, and portion-controlled to minimize cognitive load while staying supportive. This aligns with prior coaching notes about quick checks and logging, and reduces risk of a binge by providing a clear, low-effort option.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable today. I’ll go with the yogurt-and-berries snack—1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt with 1/2 cup blueberries—it's simple and fits my routine. If dairy ends up bothering me, I’ll switch to 1/2 cup unsweetened almond yogurt with berries. I’ll drink a full glass of water with it, take the 1–2 minute mindful pause after I eat, and log the snack tonight. I’m also open to the 10‑minute light walk after dinner if I have the energy, but at least I’ll check in with my fullness and keep it gentle. If cravings come up later, I’ll reach for a small, sensible option and remind myself I’m following a plan today."
