Set a reminder to help you stay on track. If you’re still hungry after breathing, choose a small BED-friendly snack like 1 small apple with 1 tablespoon peanut butter or a half-cup of yogurt.

    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the plan. The 7–9 pm routine with a 3-minute box breathing and mood/hunger logging sounds doable, and I’ll set the reminder. I do have one tweak: I’d prefer a flexible start time instead of a fixed window, so I can begin when urges rise rather than at a set hour. I’ll log mood and hunger right after the breathing. If I’m still hungry, I’ll choose a small BED-friendly snack like 1 small apple with 1 tablespoon peanut butter or 1/2 cup yogurt. I’ll keep a water bottle nearby to stay hydrated. If I miss logging, I’ll do a quick 1-minute breathing and log as soon as I remember. If cravings spike, could we add quick coping options like a 10-minute walk or a few minutes of journaling or a quick call to a friend? That would help me stay on track.

Add a one-word descriptor if you like (calm, restless, overwhelmed).\n  - Hunger: rate 0–4 (0 = not hungry, 4 = very hungry).\n  - Urge intensity: 0–10 (0 = no urge, 10 = strongest urge).\n  - Action taken: check boxes for box breathing, 10-minute walk, journaling, quick call, snack, water.\n\n- Have a default template you can tap quickly:\n  Mood: __ /5 • Hunger: __ /4 • Urge: __ /10 • Actions: [Breathing] [Walk] [Journaling] [Call] [Snack] [Water]\n  (If you’re in a rush, fill the essential fields only: Mood, Hunger, Urge, and one action you took.)\n\n- Use simple descriptors instead of numeric values when you’re short on time:\n  - Mood: calm, neutral, stressed, tired, irritable\n  - Hunger: none, light, moderate, strong\n\n- Log immediately after the breathing as you planned, then add mood/hunger and any quick notes in one line if possible.\n\n- Keep it consistent with prompts you already use:\n  - Tonight: Box breathing completed → Mood/Hunger logged → Urges 0–10 → Coping action chosen → Snack/Water if needed.\n\n- Create quick-entry hooks (what you can memorize):\n  - After breathing: “Mood: 3; Hunger: 2; Urge: 6; Action: Walk”\n  - After craving spike response: “Walk done; Journaling next if urge persists.”\n\n- Use a simple reminder workflow:\n  - Reminder to start when urges rise.\n  - If you miss logging, do a 1-minute breathing plus one quick log entry as soon as you remember.\n\n- Visual aids help: a small card or note with the log fields you keep by your device, or a one-line template you can copy-paste.\n\n- Hydration cue: since it’s warm (32°C), add “Water: yes/no” to the log so you remember to sip during cravings.\n\nIf you’d like, I can craft a ready-to-use one-line log template you can memorize or paste into your log app. Would you prefer a printable card or a digital template (short, one-line, or multi-field) you can quickly tap?",
