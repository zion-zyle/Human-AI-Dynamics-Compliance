  "user_action_estimate": 4.5,

  "confidence": 0.8,
  "basis": "The user consistently articulates concrete actions (reset cue, nasal breathing 60–90 seconds, grounding if urge persists, modest yogurt + fruit + nuts or warm beverage, iced water during grounding, post-dinner reminder, bedtime reflection) and commits to using templates and prompts. They acknowledge possible adjustments (shorter breathing bursts, rotating templates) and request a log reminder timing—indicating intent and planning rather than hesitation.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Low. The user shows alignment between stated intentions and planned actions, with minor potential tension around maintaining motivation vs time burden, which is addressed by simplifying steps and offering ready-to-use templates.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Minimal; occasional concern about time and effort, but no persistent negative self-talk. Potential mild perfectionism risk in wanting to track many fields, mitigated by multiple template options.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Heat/stress and BED-related urges. Thirst/hydration needs during grounding. Anticipation of overwhelm.",
  "effective_reinforcement": [
    "Clear, actionable steps",
    "Ready-to-copy templates",
    "Micro-commitments",
    "Prompt feedback",
    "Encouragement and normalization of resets"
  ],
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain the practical, modular approach. Offer rotating templates to sustain engagement; reinforce quick resets; continue requesting mood/hunger logging after snacks to reveal patterns; remind about log timing and hydration. Consider introducing a weekly reflection to review trends and adjust goals."
