I tend to binge in the evenings, so could we add a sunset reminder for a short pause? And if journaling feels like too much some nights, any lighter alternative that still helps me stay aware?"

Lighter journaling options (pick one or mix): 1) one-line reflection: 'Craving 6/10, avoided snack; feeling calmer.' 2) emoji mood log: choose 2–3 emojis (e.g., 🙂, 😣, 🫶️). 3) quick 5–10 second voice note describing the urge and response. 4) a 3-word summary: 'heat, water, pause.'

For BED urges: if the urge is strong (7+), extend the delay to 20 minutes and add 1 extra breathing round; if very strong (8–9), extend to 30 minutes and add 1–2 extra rounds. If needed, physically step away for a minute. Micro-snack option: yes, if you’re truly hungry. opt for a tiny portion (about 100–150 kcal) with some protein/fiber (e.g., a small yogurt, an apple with a thin spread of peanut butter, or a small handful of nuts).
