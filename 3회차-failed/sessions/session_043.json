    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the quick plan. I like the breathing, the mood/hunger log, and staying hydrated. Given BED, evenings can derail me, so I’m glad it’s lightweight and doable. I’ll try 3 minutes of nasal breathing tonight, then write a one-line mood/hunger log, sip water, and if a craving hits I’ll choose a small, balanced option like an apple with peanut butter and log it. I might also set a quick post-dinner reminder and plan a brief bedtime reflection to refine labels tomorrow. If I start to feel overwhelmed, could we add a simple reset cue—pause, name the urge, and breathe? And could you offer a few more snack ideas that feel comforting but are less likely to trigger binge urges?"

Comforting, lower-trigger snack ideas to rotate tonight: - Apple with a tablespoon of peanut or almond butter - Banana with a thin layer of almond butter - Plain or Greek yogurt with cinnamon and a few berries - Cottage cheese with pineapple or berries - Rice cake with avocado or a light smear of cream cheese - Whole-grain crackers with hummus - Air-popped popcorn (lightly salted or a dash of cinnamon) - A small handful of almonds or walnuts with a few dark chocolate chips (1–2) - Chia pudding made with almond milk and a few fruit pieces - A small smoothie with spinach, frozen berries, and yogurt - A warm mug of herbal tea with a small square of dark chocolate.

If I still feel off, could we add a quick non-food grounding task (like a 2–3 minute body scan, water, or a brief stretch) before I decide? Also, it would help to tailor snack ideas to things I actually enjoy and find filling—I tend to reach for yogurt with fruit, nuts, or a warm beverage, so could we add more variations around those?
