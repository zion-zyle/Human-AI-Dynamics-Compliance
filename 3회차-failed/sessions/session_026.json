Stay in a cool space and maybe a short 2-minute stretch to finish. Want me to set a reminder to log after you snack?",

    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that plan feels doable. I’ll aim for a light, protein-rich snack around 150–180 kcal and drink some water tonight. I’ll try the 5‑minute urge-surf if cravings show up, and I’ll log my snack and mood right after. A reminder to log would help me stay accountable. If cravings return, I’ll choose a small portion (≤250 kcal) and stop there. Could you set a reminder to prompts me to log after I snack? Also, if I’m feeling overwhelmed, a quick 2‑minute breathing exercise would be nice."

    "agent_utterance": "Excellent plan. Here’s how to set up a post-snack reminder and a quick 2-minute breathing exercise. Reminder setup (choose the method that fits your device): 1) iPhone/Reminders: Open Reminders, create a new reminder titled 'Log snack and mood', set it to alert about 10 minutes after your typical snack time (repeat daily). Optional: create a Shortcuts automation to remind you after you finish eating if you’re comfortable with a bit of setup. 2) Android/Google Calendar: Open Calendar, create an event 'Log snack and mood' at your snack time plus 10 minutes, set to repeat daily, and enable a notification. 3) In-app reminder: If this coaching app supports reminders, enable a post-snack notification for 'Log snack and mood'. 4) Quick log template (copy-paste after you snack): 'Snack log: [food], approx kcal, mood (1–10): [ ], cravings: [low/med/high], notes: [optional].' Quick breathing (2 minutes): Box breathing — inhale through nose for 4 counts, hold 4, exhale for 4, hold 4; repeat for about 2 minutes (roughly 8 cycles). If you’d like a shorter version, do 4 cycles. After breathing, take a moment to log your mood and cravings. Want me to tailor these steps to your exact device? Tell me your phone model and whether you use iOS or Android (or this app’s built-in reminders), and I’ll customize. I can also provide ready-to-copy reminder text you can paste right away.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: you asked for a post-snack logging reminder and a quick 2-minute breathing tool. I'll provide practical, device-agnostic steps to set reminders, plus a concise 2-minute breathing protocol and a simple logging prompt to keep you accountable.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan sounds great—thanks for laying it out clearly. I’ll use the simplest route: set a post-snack log reminder on my iPhone, about 10 minutes after my typical snack time, daily. If that ever feels onerous, I can switch to the calendar or the app’s built-in reminder. For feeling overwhelmed, I’ll do the 2-minute box breathing; if needed, I’ll drop to the shorter 4-cycle version and then log mood/cravings. Here’s a quick copy-paste log template I’ll keep handy after snacking: Snack log: [food], approx kcal, mood (1–10): [ ], cravings: [low/med/high], notes: [optional]. Quick question: should I also add a brief pre-snack check-in reminder to help prevent urges, or keep it strictly post-snack for now?"

    "agent_utterance": "Great question. I’d suggest adding a simple, 1-minute pre-snack check-in to help prevent urges, but keep it optional so you don’t feel obligated. Try this quick check-in: 1) Hunger level 0–10. If 0–3, drink water or tea and wait 5–10 minutes; if 4–7, proceed with your planned light protein snack; if 8–10, you’re likely physically hungry—choose a protein-rich option. 2) Are cravings present right now? If yes, plan a 5-minute urge-surf after you decide to snack. 3) Notice any heat or fatigue cues; a brief breath or splash of cold water can help reset. If you prefer, you can keep your routine strictly post-snack, which is perfectly fine too. Your current post-snack log template remains useful: Snack log: [food], approx kcal, mood (1–10): [ ], cravings: [low/med/high], notes: [optional]. Your post-snack reminder (about 10 minutes after your snack) on iPhone will still help with accountability. Would you like me to draft a ready-to-paste pre-snack check-in prompt you can tuck into a note or reminder, just in case you want to try it later? ",

    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable, and I like keeping the pre-snack check-in optional so it doesn’t add pressure. Here’s a simple version I could actually use (1 minute, optional): Hunger 0–10; Cravings 0–10; If Cravings ≥ 6 and Hunger ≥ 4, choose a plan: snack a small protein portion / urge-surf and wait 5–10 minutes / delay with water. If urges spike, try a quick 2-minute box breathing. Then either snack and log post-snack, or skip to post-snack logging.
