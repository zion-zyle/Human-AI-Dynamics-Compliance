  "basis": "The user explicitly commits to a 7â€“9 pm routine, states they will start tonight, extend breathing if the urge is strong, log mood/hunger immediately, set reminders, and adjust as needed. This clear intent and concrete steps indicate high likelihood of action.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Low. The plan aligns with stated goals (BED-friendly, gradual steps). Any minor tension centers on possible misses or forgetting logs, which the user acknowledges and buffers with reminders.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Possible perfectionism and all-or-nothing thoughts (e.g., needing to log every time; if logs are missed, guilt). Opportunities for reframing to 'any movement and logging is progress.'",

Consider a simple automated nudge for missed logs and encourage gradual habit formation via small wins."
