  "basis": "The user repeatedly endorses and buffers the plan with specific steps (hydration, snack, BED cue, alternative moves for heat, journaling prompts, logging, and contingency pauses). They express enthusiasm and commit to trying tonight, with explicit logging and adjustmentsâ€”indicating a high likelihood of closely following the suggestion.",

Reinforce logging and reflection after each cue, celebrate adherence, and normalize pauses when overwhelmed. Consider adding micro-choices to reduce decision fatigue (e.g., pre-select one backup cue for hot days)."
