I can do the 5‑minute pre‑meal pause: take a couple of slow breaths, check in on hunger on a 1–10 scale, and decide if I’m truly hungry before starting. For a simple non‑food tool, I’ll keep a quick option like a 2‑minute box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4) or a short 5‑minute walk when urges come up.

I’ll also keep the 1-2 minute post-meal note to capture what I ate, how hungry I felt, and any urges.
