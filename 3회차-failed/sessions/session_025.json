Given the heat today, let's keep it ultra-simple: 1) log tonight about what you ate and how you felt; 2) after each meal, take a 1–2 minute mindful pause to check hunger/fullness and breathe; 3) if you have energy, aim for a short 10-minute walk after dinner (or later when it's cooler). Hydrate well and adjust if you’re feeling overwhelmed. One day at a time—you’ve got this.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: it's hot (32°C) in Suwon and Tuesday evening, so keep actions ultra-simple for BED management. The plan should be one-day-at-a-time, low effort, and adaptable to heat, focusing on logging tonight, a short mindful pause after meals, and a light walk if energy allows.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the check-in. I’m going to try the post-meal mindful pause tonight and log what I ate and how I felt. The 1–2 minute breathing check after meals feels doable. I’ll aim for a short walk after dinner, but because it’s hot I may choose a 5–10 minute indoor stretch or wait until it’s cooler. I’ll keep the food log updated and note any cravings and what might have triggered them. If cravings spike, I’ll try a non-food coping move first (water, a quick breathing exercise, or a short call/text to someone) before considering any other action. Do you have a simple plan we can add for evenings when cravings are strongest?"

    "agent_utterance": "Simple Evening Craving Protocol: 1) Pause and hydrate: drink 1 glass of water or a warm non-caffeinated beverage and rate the craving 1–10. 2) Grounding: do 2 minutes of box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4). 3) Move: perform a quick 5–10 minute indoor stretch routine; if cooler earlier, a short walk works too. 4) Reach out: send a quick text or make a 2-minute call to a supportive person. 5) Delay and decide: wait 10 minutes and reassess; if the craving persists, choose a pre-planned option (a small, portion-controlled treat) or a non-food alternative (grabbing a fruit, gum, or a brief activity). 6) Log: note the craving level, trigger, and what helped in your log. Optional: keep a simple craving kit (water bottle, gum or mint, stress ball) and remove obvious triggers from sight.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: evenings with cravings are often driven by fatigue, routine cues, and heat; a simple, repeatable plan using hydration, grounding, light activity, and social support can help reduce impulsive eating while staying feasible in warm weather.",

If the craving persists after 10 minutes, I’ll choose the pre-planned option or a non-food substitute and log what happened. With the heat, I’ll lean into indoor stretches or a cooler-windows walk if possible. Quick question: should we add a hard stop (e.g., after 15 minutes) if cravings are still strong, or keep the 10-minute delay as the rule? I’m ready to try tonight and log everything."

If you opt for the hard stop, implement it at 15 minutes and then log the outcome. 6) Keep the craving kit handy (water, gum or mint, stress ball) and minimize obvious triggers in sight.
