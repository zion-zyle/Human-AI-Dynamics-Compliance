Small, doable steps to stay balanced without overthinking.",

Tonight I’ll try those four steps: water and name the craving, pick a small BED-friendly snack (yogurt with berries), do 2 minutes of box breathing, and log my mood afterward. If the craving’s strong, I’ll pause for 10 minutes and breathe. If I miss logging right away, I’ll jot it down later.
