    "agent_utterance": "Tonight's simple, doable plan: 1) drink a large glass of cold water now (or a hydrating electrolyte drink) to reduce thirst-driven snacking, 2) after dinner, take a 5-minute cooling walk or do gentle stretching to help with cravings and heat, 3) opt for a light, satisfying plate (lean protein + veggies) or a yogurt/fruit option, and 4) log your intake as soon as you’re finished (retroactive logging if needed). If cravings arise, use 4-4-4 breathing and a quick grounding pause, and remind yourself you can adjust tomorrow.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: tonight's heat in Suwon and after-work social eating can spike cravings, especially with BED considerations. I'm choosing a small, low-effort plan that aligns with a moderate effort level and is easy to implement tonight.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the clear plan—that feels doable tonight. The water, a short walk, and a light plate all sound manageable, and the breathing cue is helpful. I still get overwhelmed by evening cravings, so I might need a couple of tweaks: a quick protein/vegetable option for tonight (like chicken with greens or yogurt with berries) and a simple reminder to log right after I eat. If I miss logging, can we do a retroactive note? Also, what’s your fastest grounding trick if a binge urge hits? I’m motivated to try, but I’m nervous about night-time triggers."

    "agent_utterance": "Nice tweaks. Here’s a concise tonight-ready plan: 1) Quick protein/veg dinner options: - Option A: Chicken with greens. Sauté a small chicken breast (or use pre-cooked rotisserie) with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper; serve over quickly wilted greens like spinach or bok choy; a squeeze of lemon if available. - Option B: Greek yogurt with berries. 1 cup Greek yogurt + 1/2 cup berries + optional teaspoon chia/flax. - Option C: Veggie egg-white scramble. 3–4 egg whites with chopped veggies. 2) Simple post-meal logging reminder: set a short cue to log right after you finish eating (e.g., a 1-minute timer or a phone reminder). If you miss logging, you can do a retroactive entry by noting the approximate time and portions and marking it as logged late. 3) Fast grounding for urges: use 5-4-3-2-1 grounding—name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste; take a slow breath during the process. 4) Night-time trigger tips: keep the environment cool and comfortable, stay hydrated, and have a protein-containing snack handy if you get hungry later. If urges persist, try a brief 2-minute delay (promise yourself to wait 2 minutes, then reassess). If you want, tell me your typical night triggers and I’ll tailor this further.",

    "agent_utterance": "Here’s a quick, you-ready pre-bed routine and a simple plan for TV-time and late-night urges, plus BED risk signs to watch for:\n\nPre-bed quick routine (about 15–25 minutes)\n- Cool the room: set the AC/fan to a comfortable 21–23°C (70–74°F) and dim lights. A cooler room helps signal your body it’s time to wind down.\n- Protein snack: choose one small, protein-containing option within 150–250 kcal:\n  - Greek yogurt with a few berries (about 1 cup yogurt + 1/2 cup berries)\n  - A small piece of cottage cheese with cucumber or cherry tomatoes\n  - A slice of turkey or chicken breast with a couple of olives or a few crackers\n- Brief activity (5–10 minutes): choose one\n  - Gentle stretching or a short, slow walk around the living space\n  - 5–10 minutes of deep breathing or a quick 4-7-8 breathing cycle\n- Wind-down task (5–10 minutes): non-screen activity\n  - Journaling a couple of lines about how you’re doing or writing down any urges and how you handled them\n  - A tiny, calm ritual (e.g., splash of cool water on wrists, a brief meditation)\n- Screen rule: aim to start the wind-down 60 minutes before your target bedtime; if you watch TV, keep it to a single show and avoid scrolling afterward.\n\nPlan for TV-time or late-night urges\n- Before TV: decide a snack rule for the episode (e.g., one planned snack only, pre-portioned, or no snacking during TV unless it’s the planned snack).\n- If a craving hits during TV:\n  1) pause and do a 2-minute delay with water in hand.\n  2) Do a quick 5-4-3-2-1 grounding or 2-minute stretch nearby.\n  3) If the craving remains after 7–10 minutes, switch to a non-food activity for 10–15 minutes (e.g., tidy a drawer, fold laundry, or read a page of a book).\n- Snack strategy: keep a single, protein-containing option prepared in advance (the same options from the pre-bed snack) and avoid grazing beyond that.\n- If you’re still hungry after the planned snack and wind-down, reassess your overall day (protein at dinner, hydration, and stress). Consider moving bedtime earlier by 15–30 minutes if urges persist frequently.\n\nBED risk signs to watch for (quick checklist)\n- Repeated, strong evening urges to eat after dinner (3+ times/week).\n- Feeling a loss of control once you start eating late.\n- Emotion-driven eating (eating to cope with stress, sadness, boredom) rather than hunger.\n- Obsessive thoughts about food, planning future meals, or hiding food.\n- Nighttime awakenings or midnight eating with guilt or distress.\n- A trend of failing to log or late logging followed by guilt or self-criticism.\n\nIf you notice a cluster of these signs (2+ in a week), consider:\n- Adjusting dinner: add more protein or fiber, or slightly earlier dinner time.\n- Tightening the wind-down: start the pre-bed routine earlier or add 5 more minutes of grounding.\n- Reexamining TV-time: limit late-night TV to 1 hour and remove snacks from the living space.\n- Rechecking your sleep schedule: aim for a consistent bedtime and wake time, even on weekends.\n\nWould you like me to tailor these steps to your usual bedtime, preferred snack options, and your living space (TV location, kitchen proximity)? I can also suggest a compact 12-minute version of this routine for especially busy nights.\n",

    "user_utterance": "Yes—please tailor it. My usual bedtime is about 10:45–11:15 pm, so let's customize around that window. My reliable snack options are Greek yogurt with berries, and if I have pre-cooked chicken, chicken with greens. TV time is in the living room and the kitchen is nearby, so I’d like clear boundaries to reduce late-night grazing. A compact 12-minute pre-bed routine for busy nights would be great. Also, can we add a quick BED-risk check before bed and a simple 2-minute urge-delay during TV (drink water + a quick grounding breath). If weekends throw me off, a lighter or earlier wind-down option would help. Finally, I’d appreciate a simple reminder to log after meals and a plan to adjust bedtime if urges persist."

If you forget, do a retroactive entry with approximate times and portions.\n\nPlan to adjust bedtime if urges persist\n- If late-night urges occur >3 nights per week for 2 weeks, shift your overall schedule: move bedtime earlier by 15–30 minutes, adjust dinner timing (earlier), and/or tighten the wind-down by adding 5–10 minutes to the routine.\n\nWould you like me to lock in exact start times for each weekday and weekend mode, or keep a flexible window you can adapt nightly?

The post-meal log reminder should help, and I’ll use the weekend options to stay flexible. A couple of thoughts: if I’m really wiped on a busy night, it’d help to have a quick fallback (e.g., just do the 2-minute TV delay and a couple of breaths, then head to bed). Since the kitchen is near the TV, I’ll pre-portion snacks and keep the door closed.

Post-meal logging reminder: set a 1-minute alert after meals to log dinner (retroactive logging allowed if needed). TV/kitchen boundaries: pre-portion snacks, keep kitchen door closed during TV. 2-minute TV delay protocol: drink water, then a quick breath (4-4-4 or similar). Weekly check-in: Sunday 8:00 pm, quick review of adherence, urge management, and whether to adjust bedtime by 15–30 minutes. If you’d like, I can generate a printable card as a PDF or Word document—would you prefer a plain text version or a styled PDF?
