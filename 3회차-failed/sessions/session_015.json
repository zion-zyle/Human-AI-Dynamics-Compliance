Ask yourself, Am I truly hungry, or is this about stress, heat, or habit? If you’re not hungry, choose a nonfood coping option (sip water, stretch, or a quick walk) or postpone. If you are hungry, stick with the 1/2 cup plain yogurt with berries and log it, and plan a lean option later if still hungry. Stay hydrated today in the heat of Suwon.",
