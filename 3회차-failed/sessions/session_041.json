    "agent_monologue": "I can't share an internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: the warm Suwon evening can heighten cravings and make it easy to procrastinate. A short, low-effort routine that starts with a small, satisfying snack, adds a quick breathing exercise, a brief grounding moment, light movement, and hydration/logging fits the BED-focused approach and minimizes time and cognitive load.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the quick BED-friendly routine. It sounds doable, and I like starting with yogurt, box breathing, grounding, and logging. With BED, I know small, regular steps help, but cravings and emotions can still spike. I can commit to tonight's plan, but could we add a brief 2–3 minute urge-coping check (urge surfing with breathing and sensory grounding) and a simple pre-meal hunger check? Also, if I’m short on time, is it okay to skip grounding and go straight to the breathing and logging? Finally, any tips to keep my mood steadier in the evening would be really helpful."

If hunger is 3+ and you’re about to eat, proceed with a planned portion; if 0–2 and cravings dominate, consider delaying or using non-food coping.\n- If time is tight, skip grounding and go straight to breathing and logging.\n- Optional 5 minutes of light movement, water, and then log mood, hunger, cravings, triggers in the app.\n- Mood-stability tips for the evening: keep regular meals, hydrate, limit late caffeine, wind down with a quiet routine, and a brief post-dinner walk or stretch.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: given a warm Suwon evening and BED-prone cravings, I’m proposing a compact urge-coping check and a simple pre-meal hunger check, with flexible grounding and time-saving options.

    "user_utterance": "I appreciate the plan—that feels doable for BED. The 2–3 minute urge-coping check with breathing and sensory grounding makes sense. I’ll name the urge, run two quick box-breath rounds, ground myself, rate it 0–10, and decide what to do. For the pre-meal hunger check, I’d like a fast rule: rate hunger 0–10 and note two cues; if hunger is 3+, have a small pre-planned portion; if 0–2 and cravings are high, delay or use coping. If I’m short on time, skipping grounding and just breathing/logging is fine. I’ll also aim for light movement and hydration. In the evening I’ll try to keep meals regular, limit late caffeine, and do a short wind-down or post-dinner walk to steady mood. Could we fit this into my usual 7–9 pm window and add a quick reminder to log mood/hunger after the urge check?"
