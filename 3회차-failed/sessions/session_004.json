    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: it’s a hot, tiring Tuesday afternoon in Suwon, so a very brief, low-effort plan helps you stay compliant without adding fatigue or friction. The plan focuses on hydration, a quick physical reset, and a simple craving-tracking step to support BED management.",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable, especially on a hot day. I’ll start with a cold glass of water and a quick 60-second stretch now. If a binge urge hits, I’ll rate it 0–10 and note one small, non‑food alternative I can use (like water, fruit, or a short walk). If I’m too tired to go outside, I’ll do indoor movements instead and still try to follow steps 1–2. Thanks for the simple plan—I'll check back with how it went and what my urge level was."

If a binge urge hits, rate it 0–10 and write one small non-food alternative (water, fruit, or a short walk). If you’re too tired to go outside, do indoor movements for about 2 minutes (march in place, seated leg lifts, gentle shoulder rolls, or a quick breathing cycle). Given the hot afternoon in Suwon (32°C), you can also splash cold water on your wrists/face or stand by a fan for a quick cool-down while you breathe. After each urge check, log it and celebrate the small win (e.g., you did the stretch, you chose water). You’ve got this—check back with your urge rating and what you tried.",
