Here’s a simple approach: Post-snack mood check (after you log): 1) Mood rating now (1–5). 2) Urge level right after the snack (0–10). 3) Primary emotion or trigger (one word, e.g., stress, boredom). Optional: note fullness (1–5). If produce is limited, swaps are fine: strawberries (swap blueberries for a roughly equal cup), or add a sliced banana with yogurt and chia.

    "agent_utterance": "Great plan. Here are a few lightweight tweaks tailored for BED while keeping tonight's snack simple:\n\n- Keep the micro-check flow: pre-snack hunger/feelings, post-snack mood rating (1–5), urge level (0–10), plus a one-word trigger. Use a one-tap log if possible.\n- Add urge-surfing: if urges spike, take a 60–90 second slow-breathing pause and name the urge (e.g., “craving wave”). Commit to logging after the brief pause.\n- Have ultra-simple coping options ready for tougher nights: a quick glass of water, a cold splash, a 1-minute body scan, or a 1-liner journaling prompt about how you feel.\n- Produce swaps for limited produce: strawberries or a sliced banana work as quick substitutions for blueberries; pair with yogurt and chia as before. Keep almond butter handy for apple slices or banana.\n- Portion and timing guardrails: aim for the same snack structure, but if you’re stretched, shorten the post-snack check-in or reduce portions slightly to stay connected rather than derail.\n- Sleep and routine guard: try to finish snacking at least 60–90 minutes before bed and create a comfortable, cool spot to enjoy the snack.\n- Hydration: keep water or unsweetened tea nearby to support fullness and hydration.\n- Self-compassion rule: if you miss logging, do a 60-second reset and log later—progress matters more than perfection.\n\nTonight remains: 1 cup unsweetened soy yogurt with blueberries and 1 teaspoon chia, eat slowly for ~15 minutes, then log.
