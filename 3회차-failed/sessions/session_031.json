If the craving sticks around after the pause, choose a small, pre-portioned snack (for example, a small yogurt or a handful of nuts). If you're not hungry, switch to a brief 5-minute movement or a cool-down to reset. You’ve got this—steady, compassionate steps today.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: the hot, early-evening conditions in Suwon can heighten cravings and fatigue. A simple, low-effort strategy—a short pause, hydration, and a nonjudgmental check-in—reduces decision fatigue and aligns with the planned sequence for BED management. This approach helps catch cravings early and favors small, pre-portioned choices.",
    "user_utterance": "I appreciate that approach. The 30-second pause, water, and hunger check feel doable, and I like having a small, pre-portioned snack ready if the craving sticks. If I’m not really hungry, the 5-minute move to reset sounds helpful. My concern is staying consistent, especially in the evenings when cravings tend to spike; could we add a simple trigger cue or a tiny journaling prompt to help identify what’s driving them so I can tailor the plan?"

    "agent_utterance": "Great idea. Here’s a simple, low-effort trigger cue and a tiny journaling prompt you can use tonight to surface what’s driving evening cravings. Trigger cue: after dinner (around 7:30–8:00 PM local time), place a small sticky note on the fridge or set a phone reminder that says “Evening craving check-in.” Journaling prompt (use for a quick 1-minute jot): 1) Craving level (0–10). 2) What need might this be signaling (hunger, fatigue, stress, boredom, comfort)? 3) What happened just before (cue or activity like TV or scrolling)? 4) One plan-aligned action I can take now (pause, water, a pre-portioned snack, or 5-minute movement). Quick flow for tonight: pause 30 seconds, drink water, do the one-line check-in, then decide—if craving is still 4/10 or higher after journaling, opt for your pre-portioned snack or a brief 5-minute movement; if not hungry, proceed with your cool-down or a short walk. If you identify stress or fatigue as a driver, add a 1–2 minute breathing or stretching break as part of the check-in.",

    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable and supportive. I like the evening cue and the quick journaling idea. To keep it sustainable for BED, I’ll keep the journaling ultra-short tonight (30–60 seconds max) and focus on just four things: craving level (0–10), the most likely driver (hunger, fatigue, stress, boredom, comfort), one quick trigger I noticed (TV or scrolling) or 'none', and one plan-aligned action (pause, water, a pre-portioned snack, or 5-minute movement). If the craving is 4/10 or higher after journaling, I’ll choose the snack or movement; if not, I’ll do the pause and water and recheck. I’ll also aim for a protein- and fiber-rich dinner and perhaps a small protein snack 60–90 minutes before bed to blunt evening spikes. If stress or fatigue shows up often, I’ll add a 1–2 minute breathing or gentle stretch during the check-in. I’ll try this tonight and adjust if needed rather than judge myself for slips."

    "agent_utterance": "Tips for handling late-evening TV/scrolling triggers beyond breathing:\n\n1) Create a wind-down boundary: at least 30–60 minutes before bed, set a TV/phone cutoff or enable Do Not Disturb. Move devices out of easy reach if possible.\n2) Ready quick non-screen options: keep a small, obvious kit (e.g., a 2–3 minute stretch routine, a 1–2 minute box breathing exercise, a brief 5-minute body scan, or a warm herbal tea) within arm’s reach.\n3) Visual cue strategy: place a sticky note or quick reminder near the seating area that says “Check hunger first.” Pair it with your four-field journaling if you’re using it.\n4) Pre-commit to a non-food alternative first: if a craving hits, try a 5-minute movement or a short walk, then reassess hunger after.\n5) Environment tweaks: dim lights, cooler room, remove easy-to-reach snacks from view.\n6) Tracking cravings for a week: yes, helpful. Try a minimal approach (one-line nightly log or your 4-field journal) and review patterns at the end of the week. Look for times, triggers (TV, scrolling), and whether hunger or non-hunger drivers dominate. Use those insights to tailor reminders (e.g., stronger 7:30–8:00 PM cue, additional breathing breaks on high-stress days).\n7) Self-compassion: acknowledge slips without judgment and adjustTonight’s plan as needed.\n\nIf you’d like, I can craft a simple 7-day log template you can copy/paste into your notes.\n\nWould you like a quick one-line tracking template or the 4-field version for daily use?",
