    "agent_utterance": "Tuesday evening in Suwon is hot and you’ve earned an easy, reliable plan. Within the next 30 minutes, choose a pre-portioned snack that includes protein and fiber, plus a quick hydration step. Options need little decision-making:\n\n- Option A: 170 g plain yogurt + 1/2 cup berries + 1 tablespoon chopped almonds\n- Option B: 1 small apple + 1 tablespoon peanut butter\n\nIf dairy isn’t preferred, swap to 1/2 cup hummus with veggie sticks. Pair with a glass of water. After eating, log what you chose and rate the effort on approximately 4.3/5. This keeps you supported, reduces binge risk, and works well with TV-time tonight.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: with a hot 32°C evening in Suwon and BED considerations, a simple, pre-portioned snack that combines protein and fiber helps curb cravings without much cognitive effort. The action stays close to a moderate effort level (around 4.3/5) and pairs with a quick check-in, supporting consistency despite TV-time and fatigue.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable. I’ll pick Option A tonight: 170 g plain yogurt with berries and almonds. I’ll portion it out before TV, drink a glass of water with it, and log my choice. I’m aiming for about a 4/5 in effort. If I’m hungrier, I can switch to hummus and veggie sticks as a dairy-free backup. If cravings come up later, I’ll reach for the same pre-portioned snack instead of bingeing. Thanks for keeping it simple."
