If cravings persist, wait 10 minutes before deciding, and repeat if you still want it.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my detailed internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: It's hot (32°C) and Tuesday afternoon in Suwon, which can increase fatigue and cravings. The BED profile benefits from low-effort, structured actions that are quick to implement and reduce impulsive eating. A small, protein-containing snack, hydration, slow eating, and a brief grounding activity provide immediate support without feeling restrictive.",
    "user_utterance": "Appreciate the structure. Hydration first, and a small protein snack—yogurt, eggs, or a handful of nuts—sounds doable. I'll aim to eat slowly for about 4 minutes and stop at ~80% fullness, then do a quick grounding exercise. If cravings linger, I’ll wait 10 minutes and see how I feel. Given BED, could we add a simple BED-specific cue (like a short journaling prompt or a 5-minute walk) for urge moments and some note on late-night triggers? I’ll try this today and log how it goes."

After completing the cue, reassess the urge in about 10 minutes. For late-night triggers, implement a simple wind-down: drink water or warm non-caffeinated tea, move to a non-eating space, and do 5–10 minutes of breathing or light stretching.
