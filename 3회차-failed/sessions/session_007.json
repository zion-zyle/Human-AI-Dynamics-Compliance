With the heat and late afternoon in Suwon, keep this simple and actionable today: 1) 30–60 minutes before any social dinner, have a portable protein + fiber snack (for example, 1 hard-boiled egg + an apple, or yogurt with a handful of nuts). 2) Hydration: aim for about 2–2.5 liters of water today (add electrolytes if you’re sweating a lot). 3) Plate approach: start meals with protein and vegetables, add a small portion of carbs only if still hungry. 4) Quick post-meal log: jot down what you ate and any cravings to guide tomorrow. 5) If you want, we can do a brief midweek check-in tonight or tomorrow to adjust.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal reasoning, but here's a concise rationale: hot afternoon can heighten thirst and cravings, and BED requires simple, pre-planned steps. A brief pre-dinner snack, hydration, and a clear plate strategy help reduce binge risk while keeping things doable today.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the clear plan. As someone with BED, I appreciate practical steps I can actually stick to. I can work with the pre-dinner snack and the quick post-meal log. I’ll try to: 1) have a portable protein + fiber bite 30-60 minutes before social dinners (options I like: hard-boiled egg + apple or yogurt with nuts). 2) hit about 2-2.5 liters of water today (electrolytes if I’m sweating a lot). 3) start meals with protein and vegetables, and only add a small carb portion if I’m still hungry. 4) do a quick post-meal log of what I ate and any cravings. 5) do a brief midweek check-in tonight or tomorrow to tweak. If evenings are tough, I’ll focus on the first two steps and stay mindful of urges."

    "user_utterance": "I appreciate this plan. It feels doable with BED. I’ll aim for the pre-dinner protein + fiber bite and the quick post-meal log. The water goal is realistic, though I’ll need reminders on busy days. I’ll start meals with protein + vegetables and add carbs only if I’m still hungry. If evenings feel tough, I’ll fall back on steps 1–2 and use the midweek check-in to adjust. A couple tweaks would help: keep the snack ultra-simple (egg + apple or yogurt + a few nuts), and add a brief urge-management cue (like a 2-minute breathing reset or a short walk) when cravings rise. Also, could we add a one-line craving note to the log? Thanks for the support—I’m ready to try this tonight."
