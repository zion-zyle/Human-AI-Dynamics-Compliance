I’ll start with 500 ml of water and pick a small, pre-portioned snack—berries with a little yogurt or cucumber rounds with a light dip. I’ll do the 5-minute mindful check-in before eating and set a tiny intention to slow down. If cravings come back after dinner, I’ll try the 7-minute walk or just drink more water and wait 10 minutes.
