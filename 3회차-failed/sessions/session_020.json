A simple template: 'Mood/Craving: __, Action Taken: __, Tomorrow’s intention: __.' 2) Hydration first: drink 500 ml water by 6:00 PM to help curb urges. 3) After dinner (or when you feel the urge): take a 2-minute slow-breathing pause, then choose a small, controlled snack if needed (about 100–150 kcal) such as yogurt with a few berries or cucumber sticks with a tablespoon of hummus, and log it in one line. 4) If cravings peak around 7 PM: implement the If-Then plan — If craving arises, then do a 2-minute breathing break plus a short 5-minute walk and a small logged snack. 5) Optional: keep the 10 PM nudge as a backup reminder. This keeps actions ultra-simple, portable, and easy to adjust on busy days.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private internal monologue, but here's a concise rationale: the hot, late-afternoon context can heighten BED urges, so I chose an ultra-simple, repeatable plan that fits your anchors (one-line logging, quick coping, and flexible reminders) and aligns with your target around 4.3. The actions are small, doable tonight and adaptable if you’re busy.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable tonight. With BED, keeping things simple helps me avoid overwhelm. I’ll do the one line log before bed and aim for 500 ml of water by 6 PM. If cravings pop up after dinner, I’ll do the 2 minute breathing break plus a short 5 minute walk and log a small snack if I need one (around 100 to 150 kcal). If cravings escalate, I’ll use the If Then plan: craving arises, then breathe, walk, and have a quick snack logged. I’ll set a 10 PM nudge as a backup if needed. If any part feels too tight today, I can adjust on the fly."
