Sit still, breathe in for 4 counts, out for 6 counts, repeat for 30 seconds. Plus drink a glass of water and notice what you feel without judging it. Option B: 60-second body scan. Slowly scan from toes to head, releasing tension as you go, and check whether you still want food afterward. If cravings persist, choose a small, pre-portioned snack (e.g., a handful of almonds) or opt for grounding activities like a quick stretch or stepping outside for a moment. You can also combine: pause first, then a quick body scan, then decide.",

This respects your emotional sensitivity and the need for quick, actionable guidance.",
    "user_utterance": "I like the 30-second pause idea. Tonight I'll try pausing right when cravings start, take a quick breath cycle, then sip water and notice what I'm feeling without judging it. If cravings linger, I’ll do a 60-second body scan from toes to head and check for any tension or stress. After that, I’ll decide: go for a small, pre-portioned snack (like almonds) or use grounding moves (stretch, a quick walk outside) to reset. I might even combine them: pause, scan, then decide. Feels doable and less punitive than last time."
