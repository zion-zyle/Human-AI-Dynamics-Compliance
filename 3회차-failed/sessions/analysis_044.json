  "basis": "The user repeatedly confirms testing tonight with exact defaults and an on-device, privacy-focused setup. They explicitly state readiness to test day one, allow skipping the check-in, and want an auto-fill script. This strongly indicates they will implement and perform the plan.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Low. The plan aligns with their BED goals and privacy needs; minor tension about feasibility on busy nights is mitigated by flexible check-in and optional prompts.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Possible perfectionism about adhering exactly to prompts/logs; occasional avoidance of logging when rushed; risk of cognitive load if too many steps.",
