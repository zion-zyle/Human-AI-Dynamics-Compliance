  "user_action_estimate": 2.5,
  "compliance_estimate": 0.46,
  "confidence": 0.78,
  "basis": "The user repeats a conditional, non-committal stance (only if mood and environment are supportive) and has a history of postponing or declining concrete actions despite verbal openness. This suggests a moderate-to-low likelihood of taking action, aligning with a 2.5 estimate. Compliance calculation factors in that the userâ€™s statement is contingent and non-binding, yielding a modest compliance around 0.46 when considering the last suggested S = 1.09.",
  "coaching_notes": "Keep offering ultra-small, voluntary options and clear, brief check-ins. Validate feelings and emphasize control (the user decides). Break decisions into micro-steps (e.g., 1 sip of juice only if mood and environment are supportive). Explore practical barriers (fatigue, anxiety) and consider adjusting timing to coincides with calmer moments. Track cues (mood, environment) and respond with actionable, non-pressuring prompts."
