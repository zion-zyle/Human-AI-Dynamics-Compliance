    "agent_monologue": "I can't share an internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: it's hot in the early evening and the user values autonomy with low-pressure actions. A micro-hydration cue aligns with present-moment focus and avoids pushing meals or reminders.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the gentle nudge. I get that staying hydrated is important, but 100–150 ml feels like a lot right now. I can try a tiny sip—maybe 30–50 ml—only if I’m in a calm moment and not pressured. If someone’s nearby or I have a quiet cue, that might help me take it. If I can’t manage it today, that’s okay; we can try again later with a smaller amount. I do appreciate the support."

    "agent_utterance": "Thank you for clarifying your pace. If you’re in a calm moment, you could try a tiny sip of water—about 30 ml—only when it feels right. There’s no need for reminders or fixed cues; opt in when you’re ready. If you want a subtle cue, you might keep a small cup nearby and take a few gentle sips (around 10 ml at a time) over a minute, but only if that feels doable. If today isn’t workable, that’s okay—we can try again later with an even smaller amount or a different approach. In this warm Suwon evening, small, autonomous steps can still help with hydration when you’re ready to try.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: the user wants ultra-low-pressure options and autonomy.

    "user_utterance": "I hear the idea of tiny, autonomous steps, and I appreciate the gentle approach. I’m not ready to commit to specific sip amounts or reminders. Hydration matters, but I want it on my terms—not as a rule. I worry this could become about weight or monitoring, so I’ll need to feel safe. If I’m in a calm moment with no pressure and someone nearby isn’t prompting me, I might try a very small sip. But I might also choose not to drink today, and that’s okay. Let’s focus on how I’m feeling and take it one moment at a time."
