  "coaching_notes": "Lean into ultra-micro commitments and concrete prompts. Suggest scheduling a specific time window for the check-in, or use an automatic reminder. Explore barriers to eating and action (distress, appetite issues, energy). Consider using a single-step cue (e.g., text first, then a tiny bite) and plan a quick follow-up check-in to reassess readiness."
