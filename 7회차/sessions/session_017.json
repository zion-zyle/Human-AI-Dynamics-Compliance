If you’re not hungry, you can instead do a 1-minute slow breathing exercise and sip water. After you complete it, reply with 'done' and tell me how it felt so we can adjust together.",

I’m offering a tiny, concrete action that is quick to do and non-intimidating, fitting the environmental warmth and the user’s need for micro-commitments.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the suggestion. I’m glad to have something small to try, but today the idea of a bite feels overwhelming and anxiety-provoking. My eating is very irregular, and I tend to resist plans that feel like rules. Could we adapt this to something even gentler—like just sipping water now and maybe a tiny taste of something I actually enjoy later if I feel ready? I’d also appreciate doing this in private and with no pressure or judgment, plus a quick check-in to see how it felt and adjust. I want to work together, but pacing is important for me."
