  "basis": "The user verbally commits to a private, low-pressure action (sip now) with flexible timing and no obligation, but their past pattern in similar interactions shows a tendency to hesitate or opt for non-action when anxious. A 2.5 reflects a modest likelihood of taking the initial step, tempered by the preference for pacing and avoidance of rules.",
  "coaching_notes": "Respect the user’s pace and private setting. Reinforce non-judgmental support and offer observable, easy-to-complete steps (e.g., a single sip) tied to hydration rather than eating. Monitor for anxiety spikes and be prepared to adapt without pushing for further steps; consider reinforcing autonomy and focusing on small, voluntary choices that don’t feel like obligations."
