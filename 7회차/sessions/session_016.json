But honestly, my eating is all over the place and I’m usually resistant to meals or guidance.

If today you still can’t eat, here’s a tiny plan for tomorrow: 1) In the morning, text your trusted person with one exact ask: ‘Could you check in for 10 minutes at 6 PM tomorrow?’ 2) Have a plain yogurt or banana ready in the fridge so you can take a very small bite if you feel even a tiny urge. 3) If eating still isn’t possible, send a quick message to your friend to rebook the short check-in and aim to try a single sip of water or a tiny bite later in the day. The aim is a real-time cue + ultra-simple action. Want me to tailor the message or time to someone specific you have in mind?",
