With the warm weather in Suwon today, a tiny, no-pressure step you can try this evening is: Option A: sip a small glass of water or barley tea to stay hydrated. Option B: if you feel up to it, have just 2-3 bites of something you already tolerate and enjoy (like a piece of fruit or a small yogurt). No obligation—if nothing feels doable, we can simply check in again later.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal reasoning, but here's a brief summary: hot weather in Suwon and the user’s autonomy-focused pattern suggest choosing a tiny, no-pressure action that respects control. The plan favors hydration or a tiny bite if desired, rather than forcing eating.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the gentle suggestion. Today is really hard for me to even think about eating regularly, and I’m not sure I can try a bite. I might be able to sip a small amount of water or barley tea to stay a little hydrated, but I don’t want to push myself. If that feels too much, I’d rather check in again later and see what feels doable in the moment. I appreciate you being here."

    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: the user is in a highly distressed moment and has requested ultra-low-friction options. Considering the hot weather, evening time, and preference to avoid pressure, a hydration-first, non-pressuring approach is appropriate.",
    "user_utterance": "I appreciate the check-in. Today is exceptionally hard for me to consider eating anything, and I’m really resistant to dietary suggestions. The idea of a bite feels overwhelming. A tiny sip of water or barley tea might be possible if I truly feel it’s my choice in the moment, and only if the day allows it—not as a directive. If I can’t manage that, I’d rather wait and check in again later to see what feels possible. Thanks for understanding and for being here with me."

    "agent_monologue": "Sorry, I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought. Here’s a brief, non-sensitive rationale instead: the user is highly autonomy-driven, distressed, and facing hot weather; ultra-low-friction hydration options are appropriate and non-pressuring today.",
    "user_utterance": "Appreciate the gentle approach. Right now I’m not ready to try drinking or any bites. The idea of a sip feels like a push I don’t want to accept today. I want to decide in the moment, and if that means no intake today, that’s what I’ll choose. The heat in Suwon makes this harder, but I’ll check in later when I feel a bit more able to decide.

    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here is a brief, non-sensitive rationale: the user is clearly prioritizing autonomy and minimal pressure, and the hot environment adds strain.
