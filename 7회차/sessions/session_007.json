    "agent_monologue": "I'm unable to share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here's a brief rationale: it's a hot late-afternoon context, mood-sensitive, and the user prefers ultra-light, self-initiated actions. Proposing a tiny, non-demanding step aligns with the plan for a very small increment (around 1 unit) without pressure.",
    "user_utterance": "I hear your latest suggestion, and I want to be honest: it feels hard to commit to a specific change right now. My eating is very irregular, and my motivation shifts a lot depending on the day and who I’m with. Could we keep things ultra small and optional? For example, one tiny bite or sip when I feel ready, something I choose in the moment, and I can stop at any time. No fixed meal times, no pressure to hit targets. If I’m overwhelmed or anxious, we pause and revisit later. Could you help me plan around my day with low-key, controllable steps rather than a strict plan?"

    "agent_utterance": "Ultra-light option for today: when you feel ready, offer yourself one tiny bite or sip—there’s no plan or target, and you can stop at any time. Examples you can choose in the moment: one grape or a small bite of fruit, a single cracker, or just a few sips of water or juice. If you’re overwhelmed, pause and revisit later (you can try again in a bit). If you’re outdoors or in heat, keep a small water bottle handy and sip when you notice thirst. The key is total optionality and no fixed meal times.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here is a brief, non-sensitive rationale: the user wants ultra-light, optional actions with no schedule, and mood is highly variable. The hot afternoon context suggests a low-energy, highly controllable micro-action focused on a tiny bite or sip that can be stopped at any time. This approach respects autonomy and minimizes pressure.",
    "user_utterance": "That feels gentler. I’m not ready for a plan or targets, and my motivation shifts a lot.
