    "user_utterance": "I hear your one-spoon suggestion for dinner, and I know you want me to try, but just thinking about eating more right now makes me anxious. My eating is very irregular and I’m usually resistant to changes, especially when I’m tired. Could we start even smaller or choose something I’m more comfortable with—like a tiny bite of something I enjoy or a few sips of juice—and maybe you check in a bit closer to mealtime tomorrow so I can decide in the moment?"
