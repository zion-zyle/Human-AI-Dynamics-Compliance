  "basis": "The user explicitly rejects fixed cues and reminders, prioritizes total control and staying present with hydration, and frames their behavior as minimal (drinking water, staying in the moment). Past behavior in the conversation shows a pattern of opting out or delaying engagement with structured plans, suggesting only limited, self-initiated action this time.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a stance of autonomy and ultra-low-pressure options. Future strategies should center on user-initiated micro-engagements and exploring barriers (triggers, environment, timing) without imposing reminders. Focus on identifying safe, reversible steps the user can opt into when ready."
