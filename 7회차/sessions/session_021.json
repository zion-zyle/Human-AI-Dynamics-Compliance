To honor the user's autonomy and keep things pressure-free, I'll propose a single, non-food trigger prompt that aligns with the planned focus.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the latest suggestion. I want to work with you, but my appetite is very unpredictable and I get anxious about changing my routine. When a plan feels too scheduled or pressure-filled, I tend to resist. Could we try something tiny and flexible, like a small yogurt or fruit snack at a time that doesn’t feel rigid? If I can choose the moment and keep it low-key, I might be more willing to try it and we can reassess together. I’m not sure I can commit to the full plan today, but a tiny step feels possible."

You decide the snack and the moment—no fixed schedule, no pressure. If you’d like quick options, you could choose a small yogurt cup (about 120–150 g) or a medium apple/banana. If today doesn’t feel right, that’s okay too—we’ll reassess together later.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here’s a concise rationale: you asked for a tiny, flexible step that respects your pace. A single, low-pressure snack moment fits your autonomy and the warm, relaxed evening in Suwon without adding pressure.",
    "user_utterance": "I appreciate keeping this flexible. For me, any plan still feels heavy, so I want to keep it ultra low-key.
