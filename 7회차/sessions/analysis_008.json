  "basis": "Past interactions show the user consistently opts for ultra-small, flexible actions rather than fixed routines. They explicitly commit to starting with the 1번 배고픔/포만감 신호 task and pace themselves, even when acknowledging external prompts. Using the last stated action level (3.0) aligns with their pattern of cautious yet tangible engagement in tiny steps.",
  "coaching_notes": "Support the user's preference for tiny, non-rigid steps. Explore triggers behind external prompt susceptibility and offer a short menu of optional micro-actions. Use reflective questions to gauge readiness and consider adding a simple if-then plan to reduce decision fatigue each day."
