    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the gentle nudge. I know small steps can help, but right now my eating feels really uncertain and I’m resistant to any food-focused plan. I can maybe try the breathing exercise and a glass of water if I’m not pushed to 'eat,' but I don’t want meals to be the focus today. Could we keep it non-food first and let me choose a micro-habit that fits this moment (like 5 minutes of breathing or a quick check-in)? I’ll try the breathing and water and report back this evening, around 8 if that’s okay."

    "agent_utterance": "Here’s a tiny non-food micro-habit you can start now. Pick one:\n\nOption A (recommended): Do 5 minutes of slow breathing: inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds, continuing for 5 minutes. Sit comfortably with shoulders relaxed. Sip about 200 ml of water during or right after. Afterward, note how you feel and plan to check in around 8 PM.\n\nOption B (quick check-in): Take 60 seconds to describe your current mood with 1–2 words, then drink a glass of water. This keeps the focus away from eating and helps gauge your moment.\n\nIf you’d prefer a different micro-habit later, we can switch. Your pace matters, and your check-in at 8 PM is perfectly fine.",
