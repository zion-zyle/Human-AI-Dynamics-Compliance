  "basis": "The user repeatedly refuses prompts or commitments and emphasizes being self-directed with no pressure or goals. The final statement focuses on pausing and waiting for readiness, showing no clear intent to act soon. This aligns with a consistently low action propensity based on past behavior.",
  "coaching_notes": "Indicator of polite non-compliance. Investigate underlying barriers to taking action, keep support ultra-light and user-initiated, and avoid pushing prompts. Monitor for any shift in readiness over time and consider offering non-eating-related, optional supports only when initiated by the user."
