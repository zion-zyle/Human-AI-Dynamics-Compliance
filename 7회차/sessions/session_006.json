    "agent_monologue": "I weighed the hot 32°C environment in Suwon and the user's high emotional sensitivity, along with the coaching notes to keep prompts ultra-light and non-eating. So I chose a tiny, non-pressure action that centers hydration and grounding to match their readiness.",

My routine feels really unstable, and I often follow what’s happening around me more than any plan. If we try something, I need it to be tiny and optional—like a small snack I actually enjoy or a sip of something—with no pressure. I’d like to talk about what’s making today hard and figure out a pace that feels safe for me, not a rule or goal."

Let’s keep things ultra-light and optional. Try one of these if it appeals: 1) a tiny sip of water or a preferred drink, followed by three slow breaths, and notice one sensation in your body (like your feet on the floor or the chair supporting you); 2) a very small bite of something you truly enjoy, only if you want it and with no pressure or goal; 3) a quick grounding: name five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste. If none of these feels right, that’s totally fine. Want to check back in in about 15–20 minutes or whenever you feel ready? What feels safest for you right now?",

Can we just talk about what’s happening and check in in a bit to see if I want something tiny later—only if it’s truly optional and something I enjoy? If we try anything, I’d want it to be completely voluntary and paced by me."
