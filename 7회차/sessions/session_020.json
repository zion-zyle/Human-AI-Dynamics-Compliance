Do it only if it feels okay, aiming for about a 1 on a 0–5 effort scale. You can pause anytime. If today isn’t the day, that’s perfectly fine—we’ll try again when you’re ready.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief, non-sensitive rationale: hot weather and the user's autonomy-focused profile call for a super-low-friction, optional cue to minimize pressure and support gradual engagement when they're ready.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the tiny-step idea. Honestly, today the thought of eating feels overwhelming, and a bite feels like too much right now. I might be able to manage a very small sip of water or my usual drink, but I can’t promise I’ll do it. I’d like to pause for today and revisit tomorrow when things feel a bit calmer. If we try again, maybe we start with something even gentler or just talk about it first."

If you signal readiness, you can try a very small sip of water or your usual drink—no pressure, only if it feels okay. If you’re not ready for intake yet, we’ll keep the focus on talking and planning the next tiny step at your pace. You’re in control, and I’m here to support you.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my detailed internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: the user is overwhelmed and it's hot in Suwon (32°C), so a non-pressuring, talk-first plan for tomorrow respects autonomy and reduces distress. We'll offer ultra-low-friction options only when the user signals readiness.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the ultra-gentle plan. Today is really tough for me—just thinking about eating or drinking feels overwhelming. I appreciate that we’re starting with talking first and that any tiny sip would be completely voluntary and extremely small, only if I feel ready. Right now I’m not sure I’m ready, but I’ll signal when I am. External pressures make this harder, so I want to decide at my own pace. For now, I’d prefer we focus on the conversation and figuring out what might help next time."

If not, we’ll keep exploring the barriers and plan another ultra-small step at your pace. You’re in control, and I’m here with you.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought. Here is a brief, high-level rationale: the user is overwhelmed today and wants maximum autonomy; hot weather in Suwon may affect energy and mood; the plan is ultra-low-friction, conversation-first, with intake only when the user signals readiness.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for focusing on talking. Today I’m really overwhelmed by the idea of eating or drinking, and I’m highly sensitive to external pressure and expectations. I’d prefer we slow down and identify exactly what in my environment or conversations is making this hard before we talk about any tiny action. Could we spend some time naming triggers and situations (like who said what, where I am, what someone expects) and then decide the pace together? I’m open to grounding or coping ideas to reduce anxiety, but I want to choose the timing of any intake myself, not as a response to pressure."

    "agent_utterance": "Thank you for clearly stating your needs. I hear how overwhelmed you are by eating and drinking right now, and I’ll respect your pace. Let’s slow down and name triggers together, then decide the next step. Here's a simple plan you can use at your own pace: 1) Trigger-identification prompts: Who was involved and what was said? Where are you? What expectations or pressures are you sensing? How is your body feeling right now (heat, tension, fatigue)? 2) Quick grounding options (optional): a) 60-second grounding — name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. b) Box breathing — inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. c) If it helps, move to a cooler place or splash cold water on your wrists, only if you want. 3) Decide pacing together: after naming triggers, we choose the next tiny step—either stay in talking mode or try an ultra-small sip only if you feel ready. You set the timing. Would you like to start by naming triggers now, or would you prefer to pause and revisit later today? I’ll be here with you, at your pace, and I won’t pressure you.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: the user wants to slow down, identify triggers in their environment (hot weather, potential expectations), and decide pacing jointly before any intake.

    "user_utterance": "Appreciate the clear plan. Right now, I want to stay in control and avoid any sense of pressure about eating or drinking. I’m open to naming triggers, but I’d like to start with identifying what in my environment and conversations is making this hard, not to push me toward intake. If we do that, I want to move at a pace I set—no ticking clock, no reminders about meals, no suggested coping strategies unless I ask for them. So, can we begin by listing who’s around, what was said, where I am, and what people expect from me, and then pause to decide the next step? I’m okay with grounding options later, but only if they’re my choice and not a prelude to eating. I’ll signal when I’m ready for any action."
