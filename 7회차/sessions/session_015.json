    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the gentle nudge. Today I feel very resistant and my eating patterns are all over the place. A tiny sip of water might be doable if I’m in a calm moment and someone is with me for support. If not, I’d rather pause and try again later.

What's one small thing that could help you feel a bit steadier right now (for example, a calm moment, a glass of water, or having someone with you)? If you’re in a calm moment with support, we can plan for a tiny sip of water. If not, we’ll pause and revisit later. Would you like to proceed with the check-in now?",

    "user_utterance": "I hear you, and I’m feeling very resistant right now. My eating patterns are all over the place, and I’m easily influenced by outside cues. I’d really need someone with me or to pause and revisit later. If I did a mood/hunger check-in, I’d probably rate mood at about 3-4 out of 10 and hunger at 1-2 out of 10, but giving numbers feels risky and not helpful today. I’d rather not push eating. If we proceed, can we keep it for a time when I have real support nearby, maybe starting with a calm moment and a tiny sip of water only then? For now, can we schedule this check-in for later today or tomorrow with a trusted person, or check in when I feel steadier?"

Here’s a simple, doable plan you can use now or later: 1) pick a trusted person you can have with you today or tomorrow. 2) if you’d like, I can draft a short message you can copy-paste to invite them (for example: 'Hi [Name], I’m feeling a bit off today and could use your support for a calm moment later this evening or tomorrow morning. Are you available to be with me?'). 3) choose a specific time window that feels doable (e.g., this evening 7–8 pm or tomorrow morning 9–10 am). 4) once you’re in a calm moment with that person, we can consider a tiny sip of water only if it feels safe and supportive.

    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: the user is highly resistant and relies on real-time support. They express a strong preference to postpone any eating-related steps until they’re with a trusted person or have a calmer moment. Environmental factors (hot weather) may increase fatigue or emotional volatility, reinforcing the need for scheduled, supportive check-ins rather than immediate actions. The plan is to help them arrange support for later today or tomorrow and keep any micro-steps conditional on having that support.",
    "user_utterance": "I hear you and I want to lean into support, but right now I’m feeling very resistant. I think I need real-life presence with a trusted person, not just a plan or a draft message. I’m not comfortable with mood/hunger ratings today—they feel risky. If I’m going to do this, let’s keep it ultra-simple: one short check-in with someone I trust, at a time we can actually commit to (either this evening or tomorrow morning). If you want, you can draft a ready-to-send invite, but I may not use it until I have someone with me. Can we aim for one concrete option (this evening 7–7:15 pm or tomorrow 9–9:15 am) and pause otherwise until I feel steadier?"
