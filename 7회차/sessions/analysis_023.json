  "basis": "The user repeatedly emphasizes complete autonomy and avoidance of prompts, with no commitment to sipping today. Their phrasing suggests hesitation to act, aligning with a low-action tendency despite verbal openness. Using the last suggestion S = 1.16, the predicted action around 2.0 yields a compliance estimate of approximately 0.35.",
  "coaching_notes": "Respect the user's autonomy and avoid any indirect prompts. Explore underlying comfort and safety needs behind hydration decisions. Offer non-hydration strategies for grounding and well-being, and if discussing hydration later, frame it as a voluntary option that only arises naturally, without pressure or monitoring."
