  "basis": "The user repeatedly emphasizes optional, non-pressuring choices and explicit non-commitment, citing irregular eating and environmental pull. Past behavior shows limited follow-through on tiny bite attempts, so predicting a modest action value (around 2.5) aligns with their pattern rather than taking their words at face value.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain an ultra-low-threshold approach: offer one tiny, non-food cue or momentary check-in rather than a bite. Use permission-based language and reflect back their autonomy. Explore real barriers behind verbal agreements (environment, mood, habit loops) and tailor micro-choices to their constraints. Consider journaling or simple cue-resolution prompts to identify moments when they feel truly ready, and avoid turning this into a ruleâ€”focus on flexible, optional engagement and non-judgmental support."
