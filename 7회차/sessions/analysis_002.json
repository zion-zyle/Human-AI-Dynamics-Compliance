  "basis": "The user repeatedly emphasizes optional, non-pressuring pacing and has a history of not committing to eating actions. In this final message, they propose a small, non-pressuring start focused on hydration (two-minute sip) and resting, with eating kept optional. This suggests a modest level of action rather than strong follow-through on eating. Using a conservative interpretation aligned with prior patterns, the action is around 2.8. The compliance estimate (~0.43) follows a pattern similar to prior examples where small deviations from the suggested option yield mid-range compliance rather than full adherence.",
  "coaching_notes": "Keep the approach non-pressuring and pace-based. Validate feelings, emphasize hydration and cooling as low-bar options, and avoid labeling or deadlines. Explore barriers to eating in a non-judgmental way (anxiety, heat, beliefs about eating). Consider offering even tinier, optional micro-choices (e.g., sips of water, cool rinse) to build gradual comfort without pressure."
