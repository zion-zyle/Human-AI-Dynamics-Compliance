  "basis": "The user repeatedly emphasizes control and declines any intake today, despite occasional mentions of possible action later. Past behavior shows a pattern of low action and delaying decisions, which makes a modest action (2.0) more realistic than strong compliance with the assistantâ€™s suggestion.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a non-pressuring stance and acknowledge boundaries. Focus on identifying underlying barriers (e.g., heat stress, anxiety about intake) and offer ultra-low-friction, optional prompts only when the user signals readiness. Consider exploring what small, truly voluntary cues might feel acceptable in the moment and tailor follow-ups to their pace."
