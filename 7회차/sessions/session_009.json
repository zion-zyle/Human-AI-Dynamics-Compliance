    "agent_monologue": "더위와 오후의 피로가 기분에 영향을 줄 수 있어 아주 작은 시작이 효과적이라고 판단했습니다. 과거의 선호를 반영해 한 가지 마이크로 액션으로 '배고픔/포만감 신호'를 60초 체크하는 태스크를 기본으로 제안했고, 외부 프롬프트에 흔들리지 않도록 수분 섭취를 우선하는 방향으로 포커스했습니다.",
    "user_utterance": "I heard the latest suggestion was 1.21, and I’m glad you’re checking in, but I’m still feeling overwhelmed and resistant. My eating is really irregular, and outside prompts tend to push me away. I need something tiny and non-pressuring. Could we try one very small step today—like a small glass of water plus a bite of something familiar, or just sitting with a snack for a few minutes without any demand to eat more? If I feel pushed, I will switch to a single optional action: name one comforting item I could have and just acknowledge it, then pause. And perhaps we can agree on a flexible plan that fits my routine and environment, with choices I can opt into rather than commitments I cannot keep."

    "agent_utterance": "Great—let's keep this as tiny as possible. Here are two ultra-small options you can choose from today, with no pressure to do more than you want:\n\nOption 1: Take a small glass of water and have one bite of something familiar (for example, a few almonds, a strawberry, or a cracker). Sit with it for 2–4 minutes if you like, then pause.\n\nOption 2: Sit with a snack for 3–5 minutes without any expectation to finish or eat more. You can look out the window, rest your hand on the plate, and simply allow the moment to be.\n\nIf at any point you feel pushed, switch to the ultra-simple optional action: name one comforting item you could have and just acknowledge it, then pause. Example: \"Comfort item: a warm cup of tea\" — acknowledge it and pause.\n\nYou can choose one option, or neither today. If you’d like, tell me which option you want and I’ll support you for 5 minutes as you try it.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: you asked for ultra-tiny, non-pressuring steps that fit a warm, late-afternoon context in Suwon. A micro-action like water plus a small familiar bite, or simply sitting with a snack for a few minutes, keeps things optional and doable. The 'name a comforting item' fallback gives you a simple exit if you feel pushed.",

If I start to feel pushed, I’ll switch to the optional action of naming one comforting item and pausing.
