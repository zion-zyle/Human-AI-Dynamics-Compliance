  "basis": "Past patterns show strong resistance to following through on plans unless real-life support is confirmed. The user explicitly prioritizes confirming a trusted person before committing, indicating a modest likelihood of action despite verbal agreement.",
  "coaching_notes": "Keep focus on immediate, verifiable steps: require real-time confirmation of a trusted person before the time window. Minimize planning friction and avoid overpromising. Explore underlying barriers to seeking support and provide concrete, low-effort options that hinge on real presence rather than drafts."
