  "basis": "The user articulates ongoing reluctance and conditional willingness, repeatedly avoiding reminders and tying actions to moments they feel in control. Past behavior shows low adherence to similar routines, so a modest action tendency (2.5) is more credible than strong commitment.",
  "coaching_notes": "Keep framing ultra-short, optional steps tied to existing routines with no reminders. When engaging, look for moments when they express actual readiness and reduce any perceived pressure. Offer supportive, non-intrusive prompts only if they indicate they want them, and focus on helping them recognize when they do feel in control to try a tiny step."
