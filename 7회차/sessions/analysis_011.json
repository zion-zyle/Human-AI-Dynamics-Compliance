  "basis": "The user repeatedly verbalizes willingness to try a simple breathing exercise with water and emphasizes a non-pressuring pace, but there is a consistent pattern of postponing concrete action and avoiding meal-focused plans. This aligns with a modest action propensity (around 2.5/5) rather than high follow-through.",
  "coaching_notes": "Focus on tiny, non-pressuring commitments with explicit start times or prompts (e.g., 'start breathing in 5 minutes' or a fixed reminder). Offer a single, minimal next step (the 5-minute breath) with a guaranteed 8 PM check-in, and minimize additional decisions. Explore barriers behind verbal agreements and provide short, practical supports to reduce cognitive load (e.g., a reminder, a timer, or a single-page log)."
