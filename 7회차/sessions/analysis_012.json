  "basis": "The user continues to verbalize a tiny-step approach and commits to a specific plan (start in 2 minutes, 5-minute breathing with water). However, past behavior shows a pattern of limited follow-through and reluctance to commit long-term, making a moderate action value with low-to-moderate compliance likely.",
  "coaching_notes": "Keep focusing on ultra-short, fixed steps and clear check-ins. Avoid meal pressures and help uncover concrete barriers (context, cravings, fatigue). Offer micro-adjustments and reinforce progress without judgment."
