Today try one tiny change: eat a simple, balanced breakfast within 60 minutes of waking, plus a 5-minute craving check-in (easy breathing or a short walk) when urges arise. Keeping it ultra-simple supports BED triggers without extra friction. I’ve updated your goal to 3.3 to reflect this steadier pace.",
