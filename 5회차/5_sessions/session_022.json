This keeps things simple, helps you stay hydrated in the heat, and supports your BED goals.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here's a concise rationale: with hot weather in Suwon and BED considerations, a brief, hydration- and cooling-focused plan reduces cravings and keeps things doable. I'll propose a short 15–20 minute window with simple actions you can actually follow.",
    "user_utterance": "That 15–20 minute plan sounds doable today, especially with hydration and a small fiber rich bite. I like the box breathing idea for cravings. A couple thoughts: in the afternoon I often get stronger urges, so could we swap the 5 minute activity for a quick 2 minute grounding or light movement when I am at work? For the snack, if I am not hungry right away, should I skip it and just log mood? Also it would help to have a quick list of fiber rich snack options, like apple with a thin layer of almond butter or cucumber sticks with hummus. And a reminder to log tonight after the window closes. I am willing to try it and keep things simple and non stressful."

If I’m not hungry, I’ll log mood instead of snacking; if I am hungry, I’ll pick from the fiber-rich snack ideas (starting with apple with a thin layer of almond butter or cucumber sticks with hummus). I’ll stay hydrated and only have a small fiber snack when genuinely hungry. I’ll log tonight after the window closes and we can review tomorrow. If a meeting runs long, I’ll do a quick grounding and a bit of movement anyway. Ready to try this today, and I appreciate keeping it simple for my BED goals."
