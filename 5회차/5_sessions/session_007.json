    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: the hot 32°C conditions in Suwon can heighten cravings and fatigue, so I’m offering a very low-effort, one-line action plan with a tiny craving-backup to support steady adherence and align with a moderate action target (~4/10).",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the latest suggestion. I’ll give it a try: I’ll stay hydrated with 500 ml of water, have a small protein snack if a craving hits (yogurt or a boiled egg), and do a quick 5-minute walk or 2 minutes of box breathing. I’ll log my craving and mood right after, and if the craving returns I’ll use the 10-minute delay and repeat. BED can be tough, so I’ll be patient with myself and note what seems to help today."

    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: hot weather and BED cravings make simple, short actions more sustainable today.

I’ll give it a go: drink 500 ml water, have a small protein snack if a craving hits, do a quick 5-minute walk or 2 minutes of box breathing, log craving and mood right after, and use the 10-minute delay if it returns. With the heat in Suwon, I’ll choose indoor or shaded walking and maybe do mornings/evenings. I’m patient with myself and will note what helps today.

Patterns typically emerge within 1–2 weeks of consistent logging.\n\nFlexible delays and overrides:\n- On high-stress days, allow longer delays (e.g., 20–30 minutes) or a stronger distraction, and note why. If an urge spikes, you can briefly override the 10-minute rule, but log the reason and outcome.\n\nStaying consistent (tips):\n- Keep it ultra-simple: a single-line log or quick checkbox next to each step.\n- Tie the log to a daily cue (e.g., after brushing teeth) to reduce friction.\n- Prepare a small snack and a grounding/short movement option in advance.\n- Use reminders and, if helpful, an accountability check-in (short message to a friend or coach).\n- Review weekly: skim triggers vs strategies to spot what helps most and adjust.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate a short, end-of-day reflection prompt to summarize triggers vs strategies for that day.\n\nEnd key: false",
