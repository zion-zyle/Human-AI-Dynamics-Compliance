Consider printing or opening your tracker now so it’s ready after dinner, and add a 5-minute wind-down breathing before bed.",

This aligns with your prior plan to use two quick alternatives, log, and wind down.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll try Option A tonight: a small protein snack, a glass of water, and 2 minutes of slow diaphragmatic breathing.
