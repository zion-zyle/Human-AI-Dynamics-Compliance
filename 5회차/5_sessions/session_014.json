    "user_utterance": "Appreciate the quick 4-step plan. For BED, urges can spike fast, so I will try the pause and naming first and then the breathing. I will check hunger honestly before snacking: if I am truly hungry, I will choose a small protein-and-fiber snack; if not, I will drink water and seek shade. I like the 5 minutes of gentle movement to reset, and I will keep the option to skip the snack and move straight to movement if I feel overwhelmed.

If hungry: choose a small protein-and-fiber snack. If not hungry: drink water, seek shade, and do 5 minutes of gentle movement.'\n- 3:30 PM: 'BED check-in: Pause, name craving or hunger, then breathe. If hungry: choose a small protein-and-fiber snack. If not hungry: drink water, seek shade, and do 5 minutes of gentle movement.'\n\nIf you’d like different times, tell me your daily schedule and I’ll tailor them.\n\n2) Urge-tracking prompt to use after step 2 (breathing):\n- 'Urge check: Am I truly hungry or craving for comfort? If hungry, pick a small protein-and-fiber snack (e.g., yogurt with berries or a handful of nuts). If not hungry, drink water, find shade, and move for 5 minutes.'\n\n3) Decision flow after step 2:\n- If hungry: eat the snack.\n- If not hungry: move to water + shade + 5 minutes of gentle movement.\n\nWould you like me to tailor the reminder times to your actual routine or provide device-ready texts for a specific app (e.g., iPhone Reminders, Google Calendar, or a notes checklist)?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: given BED management needs and the hot, sunny conditions in Suwon (32°C) on a Wednesday, two peak-craving reminder windows plus a brief post-breathing urge check help distinguish hunger from craving and keep movement in the plan. This keeps support practical and proactive while avoiding overwhelm.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable. I like the urge-tracking prompt after the breathing and the clear decision flow. Because cravings can spike outside fixed times, I’d prefer flexible reminders (a daily window or a couple of nearby times instead of strict 11:00 and 3:30). Also, add a quick urge-intensity rating (0–10) in the prompt and a short note field (e.g., 'hungry' vs 'stressed') to help decide between eating and moving. If you can, provide device-ready texts for iPhone Reminders or Google Calendar; I can share my schedule to tailor. I’ll start with the 11:00 AM and 3:30 PM prompts and adjust as needed."
