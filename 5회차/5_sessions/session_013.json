    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal monologue, but here's a brief, helpful rationale: today's hot weather (32°C) in Suwon and mid-morning timing can heighten thirst and trigger comfort-eating. For BED, a quick, low-effort micro-action reduces impulsive eating and supports hydration. I chose a micro-action that is easy to execute on a busy day and aligns with the goal of micro-steps (pause, breaths, water) to support adherence.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I can try that. The pause and deep breathing could really help me ride out cravings. I'll drink water after the breaths and then check my hunger. If I’m hungry, I’ll go for a small, portion-controlled snack like a small apple with a handful of almonds or a half cup of yogurt. If I’m not hungry, I’ll skip the snack and do a quick 5-minute walk or some light stretching. My challenge is sticking with it, but having a simple plan like this feels doable today. I’ll try it and let you know how it goes."
