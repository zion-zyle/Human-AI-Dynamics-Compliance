    "agent_utterance": "Great questions. Here are practical, action-ready answers aligned with your plan and the hot day context:\n\n1) Tailoring portions to hunger signals\n- Use a 0–10 hunger scale before snacking and a 10-minute pause rule: if you’re at 0–3 (not really hungry), sip water or tea and wait; if you’re at 4–6, aim for about 100–150 kcal and start with half the portion, checking hunger again after 10 minutes; if you’re at 7–9, go for a 150–250 kcal option with protein and fiber.\n- Start with a half-portion when unsure, then re-evaluate. This keeps you from automatic larger portions.\n- Plain examples to keep on hand tonight (about 100–200 kcal):\n  - 1/2 cup Greek yogurt + 1/2 cup berries (roughly 120–150 kcal)\n  - 1 small apple + 1 Tbsp peanut butter (about 150–180 kcal)\n  - 1 string cheese + cucumber sticks (roughly 120–150 kcal)\n- If you anticipate higher evening appetite (hot day, active evening), shift a little more protein/fiber into earlier meals or add a planned afternoon snack to reduce evening cravings.\n- Flex approach: if you’re unsure, pause, rate hunger again in 5–10 minutes, and choose a smaller portion first, then adjust if still hungry.\n\n2) Simple, repeatable evening ritual with one easy prep snack\n- Evening ritual (6 steps you can repeat tonight):\n  1) Have a glass of water (hydration first).\n  2) Do 5 minutes of grounding (choose 4-7-8 or 5-4-3-2-1).\n  3) Rate your urge on a 0–10 scale.\n  4) If hunger/urge is above your threshold (e.g., ≥4), have your pre-portioned snack (see below) prepped tonight.\n  5) Do a quick 5-minute walk or gentle stretch.\n  6) Set a simple tomorrow plan (times for meals, hydrate, a short check-in).\n- One easy snack to prep tonight (single-serve): pre-portion 1 container Greek yogurt (about 150–170 g) with a small handful of berries (about 1/2 cup). Keep in the fridge so it’s ready to grab and align with your grounding step.\n- If that exact snack isn’t available, swap to: cottage cheese with fruit, a hard-boiled egg with veggie sticks, or edamame (about 1/2 cup) with a few almonds.\n\n3) If urges lead to a binge despite the plan—how to adjust without feeling like a failure\n- Reset mindset (no self-judgment): label the urge, not you, as something to ride out. Use a brief grounding + hydration bump as a reset.\n- Immediate adjustments for the rest of the day:\n  - Hydration: add another 250–350 ml water; consider a light electrolyte option if you’ve sweated in the heat.\n  - Next meals: ensure more consistent protein across meals (roughly 25–35 g per main meal) and include 25–38 g of daily fiber from vegetables, fruit, legumes, and whole grains.\n  - Snack timing: if a binge occurred in the evening, move a protein-rich snack earlier in the day or add a small protein/fiber snack after dinner to avoid late-night cravings.\n  - Macros for the next 24 hours: aim for balanced meals with protein, fiber, and moderate carbs; don’t skip meals—consistency helps reduce urges.\n- Flexible swaps if a listed snack isn’t available (roughly 100–250 kcal options):\n  - Greek yogurt alternatives: cottage cheese with fruit; a hard-boiled egg with a few olives; edamame (1/2 cup) with a pinch of salt.\n  - Nut/fruit swaps: 1 small handful almonds or walnuts + an apple; 2–3 dried apricots with cheese; a small pack of roasted chickpeas.\n  - Veggie-forward swaps: carrot/cucumber sticks with 2–3 Tbsp hummus; bell pepper slices with guacamole (or bean dip).\n  - Quick protein swaps: string cheese + cucumber; 1 boiled egg + cherry tomatoes; 1 small can tuna on a crispbread.\n- If you binge, remember tomorrow is a fresh start. Use the plan, lean into hydration, and re-check hunger before the next meal. Tracking mood/cravings can help tailor the next day’s portions to your signals.\n\nStaying hydrated and keeping the quick steps handy will support you in the heat. You can keep the plan visible with a small, taped sign on the fridge or a note in your phone with the three core actions: hydrate, grounding, and a single protein/fiber snack option.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: with heat increasing thirst and appetite, using hunger signals to tailor portions reduces the risk of over-snacking. A simple, repeatable evening ritual minimizes decision fatigue and supports grounding before a single easy snack. If a binge occurs, a compassionate reset plus small macro/hydration tweaks help you get back on track without labeling the day as a failure. I’m also providing flexible swaps so you’re prepared if a preferred snack isn’t available.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that plan feels doable. I like the hunger-scale, the quick grounding toolkit, and the simple evening ritual. For tonight and going forward: 1) Portion tailoring: I will use a 0-10 hunger check and a 10 minute pause; if I am at 0-3 I sip water and wait, if 4-6 I will start with about 100-150 kcal, if 7-9 I will aim for 150-250 kcal with protein and fiber. Could we keep a short catalog of about 100-180 kcal options I actually enjoy (e.g., Greek yogurt with berries, apple plus peanut butter, string cheese with veggies, edamame)? 2) Simple evening ritual: water, 4-7-8 or 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, urge rating, if above threshold (e.g., 4) have the pre-portioned snack, 5 minute walk, plan tomorrow. My go-to tonight is Greek yogurt with berries; if not available, cottage cheese with fruit or edamame with almonds would work. 3) If urges lead to a binge, I like the reset idea. I want to phrase it as a gentle reset, label the urge, hydrate, and then adjust the rest of the day by adding a protein-forward meal or snack earlier, increasing protein and fiber across meals, and logging cravings to tailor tomorrow. Flexible swaps: tuna on crispbread, hummus with veggies, a cheese stick with apple, or a small low-sugar protein bar.

I’ll print the one-page layout and keep it visible, and hydration stays a priority in this heat. I’ll check in after tonight’s attempt. If it goes smoothly, I may adjust meals earlier in the day to reduce late-evening spikes. If I run into a snag, I’ll tell you what I’m noticing and we’ll tweak."

    "agent_utterance": "Tonight’s actionable plan: perform the gentle evening reset as planned (label the urge, hydrate, box-breathe 2–3 minutes, quick body scan) and decide. If the urge remains 4 or higher after the reset, grab a portable 100–180 kcal option from your dairy-free or nut-free list (examples: avocado on a rice cake; chickpea salad on cucumber rounds; seaweed snacks with edamame; apple + cheese stick; hard-boiled egg + cherry tomatoes; tuna on crispbread) and then do a 5-minute walk or gentle stretch before planning tomorrow. If the urge is below 4, choose your go-to snack or wait and re-check later. Stay hydrated in the heat, and use urge-surf or quick distractions if cravings persist.",

    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here’s a concise rationale: Suwon’s heat increases thirst and can amplify evening urges, so a simple, repeatable reset paired with portable 100–180 kcal options and quick movement keeps the plan practical and compassionate. The guidance aligns with your 0–10 scale and threshold-based decisions, prioritizes hydration, and uses flexible distractions to reduce risk of a late-evening binge.",

If I run into a snag, I’ll tell you what I’m noticing and we’ll tweak. Quick question: could we add a 1–2 minute pause after the reset to re-check hunger/craving before grabbing a snack, or include a short non-food activity for busy days? Also, any additional dairy-free or nut-free portable options you’d recommend for days I’m away from the fridge? I’ll share how it goes tonight.",
