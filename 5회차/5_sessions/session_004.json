Here’s your concise, action-ready tonight: 1) Hydrate and cool down now with about 500 ml water and a quick cool towel or splash; use a fan or a cool shower to counter the 32°C heat in Suwon. 2) Start urge-surf for 10 minutes: name the urge, rate its intensity 0–10, and practice a 4-4-4 breathing cycle (inhale 4, exhale 4, hold 4). 3) If the urge persists after 10 minutes, switch to a non-food substitute for 10 minutes (cold water with mint, a short walk, or light stretching). 4) Log tonight’s urges and what you tried. 5) Since evenings are tough, keep a ready substitute snack (fruit or air-popped popcorn) and add a quick 5-minute wind-down before bed. 6) If you slip, tell me what triggered it so we can adjust.
