If you’re already feeling settled, you can skip the snack and continue with hydration and your plan for later meals.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: today is hot in Suwon, which can heighten urge vulnerability. A short, low-effort reset fits well with your BED coaching history (breathing, urge logging, contingency plans) by using tiny, repeatable actions plus hydration to reduce friction and avoid overwhelming steps.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable and practical. I like the urge pause, the light movement, and the water—great quick reset for BED. I do worry I might reach for a snack too quickly, so I’d prefer a clearly defined option (like a small yogurt with berries) or to skip the snack if the craving remains after the reset. I’ll also log the urge to spot patterns and maybe add a brief grounding or box-breathing during the 2-minute pause. If cravings spike, I’ll try a short walk before deciding. Planning to test this tonight and see what helps."

If the craving subsides, skip the snack. 5) Log the urge in your tracker. If cravings spike at any point tonight, take a short 5-minute walk before deciding.
