  "basis": "The user repeatedly states clear, actionable intent to test the gentle evening reset tonight, use portable 100–180 kcal options if urges hit threshold, employ urge-surf and non-food distractions, print and display the one-page layout, and check in after tonight. They also show openness to adjustments and reporting back.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Low. The plan consistently aligns with prior statements and intent to try. Some mild anticipatory concern about late-evening spikes is expressed, but it’s framed as a solvable issue rather than a conflicting belief system.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Mild worry about late-evening spikes; potential all-or-nothing thinking is limited by their emphasis on flexible adjustments and multiple backup options.",

  "coaching_notes": "Keep reinforcing concrete, scalable steps and quick-access options. Consider adding a brief 1–2 minute hunger re-check after the reset and expanding dairy-free/nut-free portable options. Remind to monitor and log cravings to tailor tomorrow's plan. Encourage timely check-in after tonight to calibrate."
