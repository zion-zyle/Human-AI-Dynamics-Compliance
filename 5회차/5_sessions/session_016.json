I’ll rate my urge 0–10 and mood 1–5 after each block. If the urge stays high, I’ll repeat another 5-minute block or switch strategies and maybe reach out to a friend for support.

I’ll start with about 120 ml of cold water and 1 minute of box breathing, then switch to the non-food tactic or a quick 3–5 minute walk if cravings spike.

You can repeat blocks as needed and rate your urge 0–10 and mood 1–5 after each. Prep a small healthy option in advance and keep it visible (e.g., yogurt with berries or an apple with a thin nut butter). Create a simple 15–20 minute evening routine: dim lights, light stretching, quick hygiene, and a short plan for tomorrow. Implement a kitchen cutoff time and move snacks out of reach.

Start with 1–2 that feel easiest tonight, then add more as they become comfortable:\n\n- Sensory grounding (60 seconds): name aloud 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel (textures), 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste (or sip water).\n- Quick cooling (60–90 seconds): splash cold water on wrists or neck, or stand in a light breeze from a fan while breathing slowly.\n- Short chore (2–3 minutes): put away dishes, wipe counters, fold a small load of laundry, clear snack bowls.\n- Journaling prompts (after blocks or at bedtime):\n  1) What did I notice before and after the block? Urge (0–10) and mood (1–5)?\n  2) What helped most just now? What was challenging?\n  3) What is one action aligned with my goals I can take next?\n  - Urge diary template (use after each block): time, urge 0–10, mood 1–5, trigger, action taken, outcome, next step.\n- 15–20 minute simple evening routine: dim lights, 3–5 minute gentle stretch or light movement, quick hygiene (wash face, brush teeth), plan tomorrow (top 2 tasks), prep a small healthy option, kitchen cutoff time (e.g., 9:00 pm), hydrate.\n- Environment tips for hot evenings: keep a fan running, stay hydrated with a cold bottle of water nearby, keep the room cool to reduce cravings.\n- Social support: if overwhelmed, text a friend. Example: “I’m managing tonight—can we chat for a few minutes?”\n\nIf you want, I can tailor prompts to your exact bedtime and suggest a printable tracker you can use nightly.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal step-by-step chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: evenings with BED often spike cravings due to routine and fatigue, especially in hot weather.

Tailored to Suwon’s warm evenings, the suggestions emphasize cooling, hydration, and simple, low-effort actions.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that's a solid, doable toolbox for evenings. I especially like the sensory grounding and the urge diary. Could you tailor the prompts to my usual bedtime (around 9:30–10:00 pm) and give me a printable, one-page nightly tracker I can print and fill in? I'd prefer very short prompts (1–2 lines) and a simple “next step” line after each block (for example: prep a healthy snack or text a friend). It would help to have a few ready-made reminder phrases I can read after a block (for example: you’ve got this; breath in, breath out; you’re not alone). I’ll start tonight after dinner with ~120 ml water and 1 minute box breathing, then try the grounding prompts or journaling if cravings spike. If possible, include two quick alternative strategies to keep evenings flexible."
