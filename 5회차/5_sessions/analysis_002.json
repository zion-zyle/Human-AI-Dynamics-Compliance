  "basis": "User expresses clear, actionable plan with explicit steps (breathing, water, walking, urge logging, dessert substitutions) and commits to an 8 PM check-in. Positive, cooperative tone and readiness to adjust for strong urges indicate high likelihood of following through.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Low. User acknowledges potential difficulty from very strong urges but resolves it by adopting a concrete coping strategy and planning for a check-in to reassess. Minor internal tension about staying on track is acknowledged but not dominant.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Possible occasional perfectionism or all-or-nothing thinking (desire to perfectly adhere to plan). Some worry about resisting very strong urges, which could lead to self-criticism if not managed.",

  "coaching_notes": "Maintain emphasis on small, repeatable actions (2-minute practice, 5â€“10 minute walks, urge logs). Reinforce the utility of quick coping phrases and breathing to bridge between urges and alternatives. Encourage consistent check-ins and celebrate even small adherence successes. Offer alternative plan tweaks for occasions when urges spike beyond typical strength (e.g., longer breathing cycles, delay techniques, or engaging in a brief distracting activity)."
