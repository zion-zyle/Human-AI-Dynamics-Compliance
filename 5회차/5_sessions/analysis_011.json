  "basis": "The user expresses clear, concrete commitment: implementing a 3-minute micro-reset, fatigue rule, logging with 0–10 scales, reminders, and an evenings plan. They explicitly ask about automatic reminders and time-shortening, and state they will report back after the snack, indicating high likelihood of following through.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Minimal. The user shows strong alignment between intentions and plans. Occasional concern about time or fatigue is acknowledged but does not indicate active internal conflict; no contradictory beliefs observed.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Limited; few explicit negative beliefs. Occasional time-pressure framing (e.g., 'short on time') is more logistical than self-defeating.",

Consider reinforcing reminders and optional contingency plans for extremely busy days. Track sleep and caffeine as part of routine feedback to fine-tune effects."
