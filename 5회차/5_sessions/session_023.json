Keep a water bottle handy and sip regularly to stay hydrated in the heat. If you feel hungry, reach for a simple high-fiber snack (e.g., an apple or pear or a small serving of yogurt with fiber). Later in the day, log your mood when you’re not hungry for feedback. This keeps things brief, actionable, and aligned with BED management.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice plan. For hydration cues in this heat, a gentle reminder every 60 minutes is a solid default. You can set a phone vibration labeled Hydration or use a smartwatch notification; a sticky note on your desk also helps.
