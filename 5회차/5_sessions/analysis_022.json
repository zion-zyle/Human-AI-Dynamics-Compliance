  "basis": "The user repeatedly affirms the exact plan (Option B for 2-minute movement, 1-minute box breathing if cravings spike, mood logging when not hungry, fiber snack when hungry, and nightly logging). The tone is positive, committed, and forward-looking with explicit readiness to try today.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Low. No evident internal conflict; the user aligns goals (BED management, simplicity, heat adaptation) with the proposed actions. Minor residual concern about cravings is addressed by contingency (box breathing).",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Presence of mild anticipatory worry about cravings and adherence, but no persistent negative self-talk. Overall motivational and self-efficacious stance.",

  "coaching_notes": "The user responds well to concise, concrete plans with built-in contingencies. Continue providing short, actionable options (e.g., 2-minute movement, 1-minute breathing) and emphasize logging for feedback. Reinforce hydration in heat and prepare simple reminders for long meetings. Consider occasional check-ins to adjust timing if cravings patterns change."
