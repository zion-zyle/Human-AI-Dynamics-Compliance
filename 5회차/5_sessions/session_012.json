Then log your rating and any triggers. Want me to set up automatic reminders for this reset and your evening plan?",

A short, 3-minute micro-reset with quick logging aligns with the user’s commitment and minimizes effort today.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the micro-reset idea. It seems doable, but with BED cravings can spike fast, so I worry I’ll skip it when the urge is strong. I do like the 0–10 hunger rating, 3 slow breaths, and water. Could we adjust timing for high-intensity cravings—maybe start with a 1-minute wait or add a quick grounding exercise? Also I’d benefit from a couple of non-food coping options (step outside, a short walk, a quick journaling prompt) you can prompt me to try instead of reaching for food. If possible, please set reminders for the reset and for my evening plan, and help me log triggers and outcomes. I’ll give it a try today and share how it goes."

If yes, please share the exact times (e.g., micro-reset daily at 3:00 PM; evening plan daily at 9:00 PM) or I can use the defaults above. Also, tell me your preferred journaling prompts (or I’ll keep the ones listed). I’ll start logging triggers and outcomes as you try today and share a simple daily summary.\n\nIf you’re ready, I can activate the reminders with your chosen times and start the logging template today.",

I’ll also outline a simple logging template and suggest reminder setups. Please confirm reminder times or let me set defaults.",
