    "agent_utterance": "Today, since it’s hot and you’re aiming for a gentle evening reset, here’s a simple, actionable plan you can start tonight. Hydrate well (sip water consistently to help with thirst). If urges hit, use a portable 100–180 kcal option and try urge-surf for 2 minutes. Choose one of these dairy‑free options to have ready: - 1 medium apple or pear (about 95–105 kcal) - Handful of almonds (about 20–22 nuts, ~160 kcal) - 1 small rice cake with 1 tablespoon almond butter (~120 kcal) - 1 cup unsweetened almond milk with a small snack (around 100–120 kcal) - Carrot sticks with 2–3 tablespoons hummus (~120 kcal) - 1 medium banana (~105 kcal) - 1 cup cucumber slices with a splash of salt and pepper (~15–20 kcal) If you’re not hungry, try a quick non-food distractor: a 2-minute stretch, a short walk around the block, or a phone chat with someone. After you reset tonight, log any cravings and how you felt, so we can tailor tomorrow’s plan. If you printed the one-page layout, keep it somewhere visible (fridge or bedside table). I’ll check in after tonight to calibrate.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: with hot weather in Suwon and a BED plan to test a gentle evening reset tonight, a concise, low-effort plan with portable 100–180 kcal options and urge-surf steps is practical and aligns with the user’s openness to adjustments and quick check-ins.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for tonight’s plan — it feels doable. I like having dairy-free snack options ready, and I’ll try the 2-minute urge-surf plus a quick non-food distraction if I’m not hungry. I’ll prep a couple of the snack ideas you suggested (apple, carrots with hummus) and keep water nearby. I’ll log cravings and how I feel after tonight so we can tailor tomorrow for my BED triggers.

    "agent_utterance": "Great idea. Here are two additions you can use tonight and tomorrow:\n\nGrounding/breathing step for urges (about 1 minute):\n- Box breathing: inhale 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. Repeat for 4 cycles (about 1 minute).\n- Then do a quick senses grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.\n- Finish with a brief urge label: ‘I’m noticing an urge, I’m pausing now.’ Then proceed to urge-surf for ~2 minutes.\n\nTiny late-evening snack options (dairy-free, around 50–120 kcal). Pick one only if you’re truly restless but not hungry:\n- 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk with a pinch of cinnamon (~15–25 kcal)\n- 1 small rice cake with 1 teaspoon almond butter (~50–60 kcal)\n- 5–6 baby carrots with 1–2 tablespoons hummus (~60–90 kcal)\n- 1/2 cup berries (e.g., blueberries or raspberries) with 6 almonds (~70–90 kcal)\n- 1–2 squares (5–10 g) of dairy-free dark chocolate (~25–60 kcal)\n\nIf you’re not hungry, you can skip the snack tonight and use the grounding + urge-surf routine. Hydrate with water and consider a brief wind-down (dim lights, a gentle stretch, a calm playlist) to support sleep. Please log tonight’s cravings and feelings so we can tailor tomorrow’s plan for your BED triggers.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: adding a quick grounding/breathing step helps interrupt urges without relying on food, which is especially useful for BED. A tiny late-evening snack provides a low-calorie, dairy-free option for restlessness only if truly needed. Keeping it simple and accessible fits the current warm evening and your goal of gentle, sustainable behavior change.",
    "user_utterance": "I really like the grounding and urge-surf addition. The quick 1-minute breathing (box breathing) plus senses grounding feels doable tonight.

I’ll log tonight’s cravings and mood so we can tailor tomorrow to my BED triggers. A couple quick questions: how would you suggest handling triggers when I’m away from home, and if the urge-surf feels too long or not effective, should I shorten it or try a different tempo? Also, would it help to rate cravings vs hunger on a quick scale?"

    "turn": 3,
    "agent_utterance": "Great refinements. Here are practical answers for away-from-home triggers, urge-surf tempo adjustments, and a cravings-vs-hunger scale.\n\nAway-from-home trigger handling\n- Prepare a compact urge-kit: water bottle, sugar-free gum or mint, small stress-relief item (e.g., a small ball or fidget), and a quick grounding cue card with your 5-4-3-2-1 steps.\n- Pre-plan a reset spot: a quiet corner, a quick walk outside, or a nearby cafe where you can step away for 2–5 minutes.\n- Use a micro-reset protocol when triggered: start with 1 minute of box breathing (4-4-4-4), then 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, followed by a brief urge-surf. If you’re away from home and crowds make it hard, do one or two 30–60 second surf cycles with short breaths and then switch to a quick non-food distraction (hydration, stretch, call a friend).\n- If urges persist in public: postpone snacking unless you’re truly hungry; use the urge-surf+grounding combo and move to a calmer space or a warm drink (non-sugary) to break the cue loop.\n\nUrge-surf tempo adjustments\n- If the 2-minute urge-surf feels too long or ineffective: shorten to 30–60 seconds, then reassess. You can do 2–3 short surf cycles with 15–20 seconds between if needed.\n- Alternative tempo you can use: 30 seconds of urge-surf, 15 seconds of grounding/breathing, repeat 2–4 times. This keeps the coping window short and reduces fatigue.\n- If you notice a trend of limited effectiveness, switch to a different cue (e.g., a quick walk, quick stretch, or a two-minute wind-down ritual) and try urge-surf again after a short break.\n\nCravings vs hunger quick scale\n- Yes, use a simple 0–10 scale for both: hunger (physical need for food) and cravings (urge to eat, often triggered by environment/emotions).\n  - Hunger rating example: 0 = not hungry at all, 4 = mild hunger, 7 = strong hunger that could be addressed with a small snack, 10 = extreme hunger.\n  - Cravings rating example: 0 = no urge, 5 = moderate urge, 8–10 = strong urge that feels hard to resist.\n- Decision help using the scales:\n  - If hunger is high (e.g., 6–10), opt for a small, balanced dairy-free snack from your plan.\n  - If cravings are high (e.g., 6–10) but hunger is low (0–4), use urge-surf and grounding; avoid large snacks unless truly hungry.\n  - If both are high, pair a small snack with a brief urge-surf and recheck after 10–15 minutes.\n- Track the numbers in your log to tailor tomorrow’s plan to your BED triggers and settings (home, work, with friends, travel).\n\nShort recap for tonight: carry your urge-kit, use the 1-minute box breathing + 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, try 2 minutes of urge-surf but be ready to shorten to 30–60 seconds or split into micro-cycles, and use the hunger/craving scale to guide whether to snack or further reset. You’re doing well—keep logging and adjusting as needed.",

If cravings spike, re-check hunger and use a quick reset or short walk.\n\nQuick check-in: log cravings and mood after social events or travel so we can tailor tomorrow’s plan to your BED triggers.",
