You have BED and prefer quick, doable actions that support hydration and mood. The suggested micro-routine is short, movement-based, and low-effort, aligned with your plan to use desk marching, box breathing, hydration, and optional snacks, plus mood logging.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the check-in. The latest suggestion (4.24) feels doable, but I know my BED tendencies—especially in the evening—can make follow-through tough. I’d like to keep things simple: target 3 regular meals and one small planned snack (about 150–200 kcal), plus a 5-minute pause (breathing/grounding) before eating when cravings hit. Could we set gentle reminders around meals and a craving-pause, and prompts to log mood and hunger? If I'm stressed or bored, give me quick non-food options (water, tea, a short walk) first. I’m moderately compliant, so small, predictable cues would help me stay on track."

Suggested windows: Breakfast 08:00–09:00, Lunch 12:00–13:00, Dinner 18:00–19:00, Snack 15:30–16:00. 2) Craving-pause (5 minutes): sip water, then grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste; follow with 4 rounds of box breathing (inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s, hold 4s). If hunger remains after the pause, have the planned snack. 3) Gentle reminders: set light reminders around each meal window and a craving-pause cue before the snack window; add quick mood and hunger prompts after each meal and at snack time. 4) Quick non-food options for stress/boredom: drink water or tea, take a short 5-minute walk, or do a quick stretch. 5) Hydration/heat note: keep a cool water bottle handy in Suwon’s heat.
