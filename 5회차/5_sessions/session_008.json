Then choose one tiny action to move you forward: A) drink a large cold water (250–300 ml), B) have a small balanced snack (e.g., apple + 1 tsp peanut butter), or C) take a 5-minute walk in a cool spot. If cravings spike, try a 1-minute box-breathing break (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4) and log a brief end-of-day reflection instead of a full log. Stay flexible and gentle with yourself in the heat today.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my detailed internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: with hot weather in Suwon and BED challenges, a super-simple, low-friction action supports consistency without triggering stress or all-or-nothing thinking. It fits a light daily log approach and allows soft pauses as needed.",
    "user_utterance": "I like how simple this plan is—after breakfast craving check-in and one tiny action. I’ll try a large water, a small balanced snack, or a short walk, and use the 1-minute box-breath if cravings spike. I’m moderately compliant, so I’ll be kind to myself if I miss a day, especially with the heat. If mornings get hard, could we keep the check-in flexible (after any first meal) and maybe add a tiny end-of-day note about what helped?"
