  "basis": "The user consistently returns with a concrete plan, acknowledges BED challenges, and explicitly commits to the breathing routine, urge logging, and contingency resets. They propose multiple actionable steps (snack if high, hydrate/reset/dinner plan if low, optional quick resets or walks) and express readiness to implement, indicating high alignment with the suggestion.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Mild tension between BED-related anxiety and the drive to adhere to a structured plan. The user acknowledges difficulty in evenings but resolves to act, suggesting they are reconciling competing thoughts with concrete coping strategies.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Minor perfectionism and worry about evenings; occasional all-or-nothing thinking softened by practical steps. Some anticipatory anxiety about possible struggle, but no pervasive catastrophizing.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Evening time, BED cravings, stress, environmental factors (heat in Suwon). These cues increase vulnerability to urges but are being addressed with planned resets and environment cues (cold drinks, snacks prepped).",
  "effective_reinforcement": [
    "Empathy",
    "Clear, actionable guidance",

  "coaching_notes": "Maintain and expand the use of tiny, repeatable actions (2-minute pause, 4 breaths, urge log). Offer optional quick resets and grounding exercises to lower friction during high-urge moments. Reinforce environment management (prepped snacks, cold drink) and encourage brief activity as needed. Track progress with simple check-ins and celebrate adherence to the plan."
