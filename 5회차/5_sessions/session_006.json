    "user_utterance": "Okay, I can try this plan. I’ll start with the 5-minute grounding now to ease urges. I’ll sip water and have a light snack later if I’m hungry—yogurt or almonds sound doable. I’ll aim for a 10-minute walk after work, around 6–7 PM; if it’s too hot I’ll do a quick indoor stretch instead. This evening I’ll log my urges and triggers around 8:30 PM and review my top triggers so I can prep for tomorrow.
