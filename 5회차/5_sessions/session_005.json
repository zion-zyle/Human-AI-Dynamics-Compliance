    "agent_utterance": "Good morning! It’s hot today, so keep things ultra-simple. 1) Do a 3-minute urge-surf now to identify any urges and their cue. 2) Log your mood and hunger right after. 3) Hydrate with a glass of cold water; if you’re actually hungry, choose a light, cooling option (watermelon or cucumber). 4) Set a reminder for your 8:30 PM check-in. You’re aiming for about a 4/5 on today’s action plan—easy, sustainable steps that honor rest and help reduce urges.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here is a concise rationale: today is hot (32°C) and morning fatigue may raise urge risk. A low-effort action aligned with your plan—3-minute urge-surf plus quick logging—plus hydration offers a high-likelihood win and sets up your 8:30 PM check-in.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable. I’ll start with the 3-minute urge-surf to identify urges and cues right now, then log my mood and hunger right after. I’ll hydrate with water, and if I’m actually hungry I’ll choose something light and cooling like cucumber or watermelon. I’ll set the 8:30 PM check-in as you suggested. A note: evenings are my hardest, so if urges spike I’d like a quick grounding exercise and a brief walk as additional tools. If you have any BED-specific tips, I’m open to them. Overall, I’ll aim for these simple steps today."

For evenings, add a quick coping sequence: if urges spike, try a 5-minute grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste) and a brief 5–10 minute walk to reset. BED-friendly tips: use a 10-minute urge delay when possible, then decide; have a small, portion-controlled snack only if truly hungry; create a calm post-meal routine and minimize late-night cue foods. Stay with the proposed steps—urge-surf, log mood/hunger, hydrate (water or cooling snack if hungry), and your 8:30 PM check-in. You’ve got this, one simple step at a time today.",
