    "agent_utterance": "Yes. If you’re unsure in the moment, it’s perfectly fine to switch to another portion-controlled option as long as you stay within your plan’s portion guidelines. A quick heuristic: pick something with protein or fiber to help satiety and keep it roughly in the 100–200 calorie range (adjust to your daily target). Quick backup ideas you can rotate: - Plain yogurt (about 4–6 oz) - Apple or other fruit with 1 tsp peanut butter - Small string cheese or 1 oz almonds - Veg sticks (carrots, cucumber) with 2 tbsp hummus - 1 rice cake with a thin layer of nut butter - 1/2 cup berries with cottage cheese - 1 stick cheese with a few whole-grain crackers. Always log after choosing. If dehydration might be contributing, have a glass of water first. In Suwon’s heat, staying hydrated can help temper cravings and improve alertness. If cravings feel overwhelming, pause briefly, re-evaluate hunger cues, and switch to the backup option before proceeding. You’ve got this—keep it simple and press the logging button when you decide.",

If you’re under 4 and it’s more emotion than hunger, try a non-food reset first.\n- Hydrate first: drink a glass of water and wait 5–10 minutes; thirst can masquerade as hunger, especially in heat.\n- Check physical hunger cues: does your stomach feel hollow or growl, or is the urge tied to emotions like stress, sadness, or boredom?\n- Use a quick hunger check routine: 1) pause 60 seconds, 2) log your urge, 3) ask, “If I wait 10 minutes, will this craving likely fade or persist?”\n- If still hungry after the pause, choose a snack from the approved list and log it.\n- Address the emotion directly: name the feeling, use a coping tactic (breathing, a brief walk, quick stretch, calling a friend) before eating.\n- Plan for meals to include protein and fiber to reduce future cravings; keep a cool, hydrated environment to support self-control in heat.\n- If cravings feel overwhelming, pause, re-evaluate hunger cues, and switch to a backup snack option before proceeding.\n\nTonight: pause, log, and reset as needed; keep water handy and use the grab-and-go options above when you decide to eat.",
