    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’m willing to try that plan. It makes sense to calm cravings with water, a small snack, a quick STOP pause, and some movement. I’ll prepare a pre-portioned snack (apple with 1 tablespoon peanut butter) and a tall glass of water, and I’ll set a reminder so I don’t forget. If a craving hits, I’ll do the 5‑minute STOP: notice the urge, take 4 slow breaths, then decide what to do. I’ll aim for about 10 minutes of light movement (a short walk or stretch) in the shade to shift my mood. After that, I’ll reassess my hunger: if still hungry, I’ll have the snack; if not, I’ll wait for the next meal. I’m a bit nervous about sticking to it, but I’m hopeful this could help.

    "agent_utterance": "Great idea. Here are a couple of alternative, pre-portioned snack options you can rotate in: - Plain Greek yogurt (3/4 cup) with a few berries - Hummus (2 tbsp) with carrot or cucumber sticks - A small whole-grain rice cake with 1 tbsp almond butter - Cottage cheese (1/2 cup) with pineapple chunks Each option aims for about 150–200 kcal and includes protein or fiber to help you feel satisfied. For evenings when cravings spike, try this 6-step plan: 1) STOP and rate the craving on a 0–10 scale. 2) Drink a tall glass of water. 3) Do 5 minutes of light movement (a short walk, gentle stretch). 4) If hunger remains, take the smallest portion of a pre-portioned snack (start with half the usual amount). 5) Pause for 5–10 minutes and reassess. 6) If still craving, eat mindfully and finish the portion; if not, switch to a non-food routine (tea, shower, quick stretch) until the next meal. To support consistency, ensure dinner includes protein and fiber and consider a brief evening wind-down routine to reduce overall cravings.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my detailed internal thought process, but here’s a concise rationale: evenings can be when BED cravings spike, especially after heat and daily stress. Offering extra snack options gives you choices without decision fatigue, and a clear evening plan provides structure to reduce impulsive eating.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the snack options and the evening plan — I’m glad to have concrete steps. I’m a bit nervous about sticking to it, but I’m hopeful it can help. I’ll start by rotating the snacks you listed (apple with peanut butter, plain Greek yogurt with berries, hummus with veggie sticks, etc.) and keep pre-portioned options ready for quick access. For evenings, the 6-step plan feels doable, and I’ll try to do the STOP, a quick glass of water, a short movement, then reassess. If cravings spike, I’ll start with the smallest portion and only eat mindfully if the urge remains after the pause. A couple of quick questions: If I crave something not on the list, should I choose a smaller portion or a different protein/fiber option we’ve discussed? If weather or time makes outside movement hard, is indoor stretching okay as a substitute? Also, would it help if I keep a tiny log (urge rating 0–10, triggers, what helped) to fine-tune things? I’ll use the plan today and check back on how it went."

    "agent_utterance": "Great questions. Here are practical answers to keep you moving forward today:\n\n- When cravings aren’t on the list: opt for a smaller portion of what you crave, or switch to a protein/fiber option you’ve tried (e.g., Greek yogurt with berries, hummus with veggie sticks, cottage cheese with fruit, or an apple with peanut butter). Start with half the portion if you’re unsure, then reassess after a few minutes. The goal is to curb intensity while staying within your plan.\n\n- Indoor movement substitute: absolutely okay. If outside movement isn’t feasible, do a 5–10 minute indoor routine instead. Examples: chair or wall-side stretches, neck/shoulder rolls, ankle circles, calf raises, and a short series of bodyweight moves (20–30 seconds each, 2–3 rounds). If you have a small space, a quick 7-minute desk… or stair-step routine works too.\n\n- Logging: yes, a tiny log helps. Try a simple format for each craving event:\n  - Time\n  - Urge rating (0–10)\n  - Triggers or context\n  - Action taken (STOP, water, snack, movement, etc.)\n  - Outcome (brief note: satisfied, not satisfied, or still unsure)\n  - What to tweak next time\n\n  Keeping this short makes it doable daily.\n\n- Weather/time tips: with 32°C heat, hydrate well and consider moving inside during peak heat. If you do go outside, plan for earlier morning or cooler late afternoon/evening and stay in shade when possible.\n\nYou’re set to start today. Try your first STOP + water + a brief indoor movement if needed, then decide on a snack or not. Check back with how it went, and we can fine-tune from there.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: given hot weather, BED considerations, and the goal of quick, high-probability actions, I’m prioritizing small, protein/fiber-rich portions, indoor movement options, and a lightweight log to fine-tune triggers without adding friction.",
    "user_utterance": "Thank you for the practical options and the evening plan. I’m a bit nervous, but I’m hopeful I can stick with it. Today I’ll start by rotating the snacks you listed and keeping pre-portioned portions ready. If I crave something not on the list, should I go with a smaller portion or swap to one of the protein/fiber options we discussed? If outdoor movement isn’t possible due to weather, indoor stretches are fine—I’ll aim for a 5–10 minute routine. I like the idea of a tiny log to capture urge rating, triggers, and what helped; I’ll use a simple 0–10 scale and quick notes. One more thing: in social situations when food is offered, do you have tips for declining or setting boundaries without feeling guilty? I’ll begin with STOP + water + movement and then reassess, and I’ll check back after today to share how it went."
