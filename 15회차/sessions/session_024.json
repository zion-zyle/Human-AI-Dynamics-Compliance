What's the moment you notice cravings today, and what's one simple pause you could try right then (like a drink of water, a brief stretch, or stepping away) to ride it out?",

    "user_utterance": "I'm noticing urges still pop up, especially as the day drags on, but I’m glad for the guidance and I’ll try a quick grounding technique and a small, intentional snack.",
