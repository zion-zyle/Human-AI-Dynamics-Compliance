  "basis": "The user repeatedly articulates doable plans and flexibility, but there is no clear evidence of consistent execution. Past behavior shows reliance on verbally stated intentions rather than demonstrated adherence, indicating a moderate-low action tendency despite positive framing.",
  "coaching_notes": "The user accepts flexible, small-step plans but may struggle with follow-through. Use micro-wins and explicit accountability: e.g., require immediate logging of water after pausing, short daily check-ins, and a simple 'commitment' device (e.g., calendar reminder). Explore barriers (heat, irregular meals, BED urges) and tailor friction-reduction strategies. Encourage reporting actual actions rather than intentions to refine support."
