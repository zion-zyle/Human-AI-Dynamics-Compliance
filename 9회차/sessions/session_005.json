    "agent_monologue": "Considering it's a hot Friday afternoon in Suwon and the user has BED, I chose a low-effort micro-goal: a protein-forward snack after the next meal, plus a 60-second reflection and a one-tap log. This keeps friction low while supporting fullness and accountability.",
    "user_utterance": "I like this plan—having a protein-forward snack after meals could help with urges, and logging with one tap sounds doable. A couple of thoughts: my routine is sometimes really off, so I’d like a few snack options to rotate (yogurt with berries, a small handful of nuts and fruit, a cheese stick, etc.) and it would help if I have a minimal option if I’m not hungry after a meal or I can skip it if I am truly full. Also, if I miss the log, can I add it later without losing the streak? For the 60-second reflection, a shorter version like 30 seconds would be easier on rough days—something like What helped today or What triggered me this evening. If cravings spike, I’d appreciate a quick coping plan such as a few slow breaths, urge surfing for 5 minutes, or a 5-minute reset. And yes, please set a flexible Sunday check-in reminder. Let’s try this Friday and adjust as needed."

    "agent_utterance": "Here’s a Friday-forward plan you can rotate and tweak as needed. Snacking options (protein-forward, portable, cooling-friendly in warm weather):\n- Greek yogurt (about 150 g) with berries\n- 1 oz almonds (or mixed nuts) + 1 small apple\n- 1 string cheese + cucumber slices\n- 1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese + pineapple chunks\n- 1 hard-boiled egg + cherry tomatoes\n- 1/2 cup steamed edamame + carrot sticks\n- 2–3 slices of turkey or chicken rolled with a pickle\nMinimal option if you’re not hungry after a meal or want to skip: either skip the snack, or choose one of these small protein aids: 1 string cheese OR 4–6 almonds. Hydration and temperature can help, so keep snacks portable and cool when possible.\n\nLogging: You can log later if needed. Most apps allow retroactive entries or backfilling without breaking a streak—use the backfill/log-later option within the app if you miss the moment. If you’re unsure, check the help section for retroactive logging or set a quick reminder to backfill.\n\n60-second nightly reflection (you asked for 30 seconds, so here are two quick prompts you can use on rough days):\n- What helped today?\n- What triggered me this evening?\nTip: on a tight day, answer in 2–3 short phrases and finish with one small plan for tomorrow.\n\nCraving coping plan (short and repeatable):\n1) Slow breaths: inhale 4 counts, exhale 6 counts, repeat 4–5 times.\n2) Urge surfing for 5 minutes: acknowledge the urge, name it, and let it pass while you stay engaged in the moment.\n3) 5-minute reset: drink water, do a quick 5-minute walk or stretch, and rinse your mouth with water or peppermint if that helps.\n\nSunday check-in reminder: set a flexible reminder for Sunday that fits your schedule (e.g., a 9–11 am window or late afternoon). If you’d like, I can provide a simple prompt or setup steps for iOS/Android to make this easy.\n\nReady to try this plan this Friday? If anything feels off, we can adjust snack options, timing, or the reflection prompts to better fit your real-life rhythm.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: with hot weather and a hectic Friday, a rotating set of protein-forward snack options plus a minimal skip option reduces friction. A quick 30-second reflection and a practical coping plan give fast, repeatable support on rough days. Providing retroactive logging guidance and a flexible Sunday check-in helps maintain accountability without adding stress.",
    "user_utterance": "Love the flexibility and the snack rotation. The options you listed cover my bases, and I’m glad there’s a minimal option if I’m not hungry. For logging, I’m glad retroactive entries won’t ruin the streak—can we confirm there’s a 24-hour backfill window in my app so I don’t lose momentum if I forget? I’ll keep the 30-second reflection and use either “What helped today?” or “What triggered me this evening?” depending on the day. The craving coping plan is helpful; I’d also like a quick one-minute grounding option (breath or a short body scan) for peak moments. For Sunday, the flexible reminder is perfect; if weekends get busy, maybe a backup Saturday reminder too. I’m ready to try this Friday and adjust as needed."
