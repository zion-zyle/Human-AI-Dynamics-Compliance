    "user_utterance": "I like this ultra-simple plan—it's exactly the kind of focus I need. I'll choose one portion-controlled snack (like a small yogurt with berries) and pair it with a glass of water, then do the 2-minute box breathing and log it in the same spot. Cravings usually hit in the evening for me, so I want a quick backup in case the urge shows up: maybe a second tiny, BED-friendly option or a non-food reset. Could we add a simple if-then rule for those moments (e.g., if craving, then breathe 2 minutes and step outside for 5 minutes)? Also, I'll keep the log right with the snack so the decision fatigue stays low. I'll try this tonight and report back how it goes."
