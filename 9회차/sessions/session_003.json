If you still feel hungry, reach for a small portion like one small apple or a handful of grapes and log it with one click. If you’re not hungry after the water, jot down one quick feeling word (e.g., thirst or tired) and proceed. This micro-commitment is low-friction, supports BED management, and stacks with your evening routine.",

This aligns with your BED goals and your preference for small, actionable steps.",

If I am not hungry after the water, I will jot one quick feeling word such as thirst or fatigue and move on. This low-friction micro-commitment could help with BED and fits with my evening routine. A potential challenge for me is stress-driven cravings, so if cravings spike I might extend the pause or choose a non-food coping option."

    "agent_utterance": "Great questions. Here are practical, low-friction answers you can use this Friday and into next week:\n\n1) Irregular meals: fixed 2-minute buffers aren’t necessary. Use a flexible approach with a 60-second pause after water by default, and extend up to 2 minutes if meals are irregular or stress is high. If you still feel unsettled after 60 seconds, add up to an additional 60 seconds, but stop at 2 minutes unless you truly need more. Keep it simple and avoid overthinking the timing.\n\n2) Short 5-minute routine for cravings or after meals (fits in-between tasks):\n   - 0:00–0:30: 4 slow breaths (inhale 4s, exhale 6s).\n   - 0:30–1:30: gentle stretch: neck tilts, shoulder rolls, chest opener, light hamstring stretch (~1 minute total).\n   - 1:30–3:00: grounding: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear; notice 1 body sensation.\n   - 3:00–4:00: light movement: a quick walk in place or step outside for ~1 minute.\n   - 4:00–5:00: sip water and log mood/hunger with your one-click post-meal entry.\n\n3) Tracking progress over a week (simple and actionable):\n   - For each day, record: number of meals, average post-meal mood rating (0–10) and hunger rating (0–10), any binge episodes, and any craving spikes.\n   - Note days with irregular timing or high stress and see how they correlate with mood/hunger logs and binge risk.\n   - At week’s end, review which mood/hunger entries most strongly predict better outcomes (fewer binges, smoother cravings). I can provide a ready-made template (CSV/Sheets) if you’d like.\n\n4) Additional tips: keep a portable backup snack, stay hydrated (especially in heat), and use the 15-minute post-meal reminder for logging. If you want, I can tailor the weekly tracking prompts to your exact schedule and logging app.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate a quick printable checklist or a template for your week to streamline this further.",
