  "basis": "The user verbally commits to a simple, low-friction plan and previously has shown capacity to implement small steps, but BED-related challenges and travel/off-schedule contexts introduce fluctuations. A mid-range action estimate (3.0) reflects cautious optimism given the concrete plan; compliance is moderated by potential a) social/evening temptations, b) variable routines, and c) history of occasional lapses under stress.",
  "coaching_notes": "Encourage: keep tasks ultra-tangible (1 buffer, 1 pause, 1 distraction), prompt logging urges/mood, and offer quick social-script prompts for meals. Use micro-check-ins (even a 10-second mental recap) to sustain consistency. Consider lightweight accountability (e.g., brief daily recap) and gentle reminders to reframe slippage as data for adjustment, not failure."
