A micro-step plan that is ultra-simple—one pre-portioned snack plus hydration and a quick log—fits the user’s desire for small steps and reduces binge risk. This context-informed choice aims for high uptake and a gentle cadence for check-ins later this weekend.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable. I like keeping it simple with one snack that has protein and fiber. I’ll start with 150 g plain yogurt plus a handful of berries and log it as soon as I eat, and I’ll make sure to drink a full glass of water. If a craving hits, I’ll pause for 30 seconds and log it. Since my eating is a bit irregular, could you tailor 2–3 reminder prompts (for snack times or whenever cravings rise) and share a simple daily log template I can use every day? The almonds + apple backup would be great for when I’m on the go."
