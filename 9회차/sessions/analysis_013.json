  "basis": "The user expresses a clear plan and intention to test tonight with multiple steps and flexibility (cue timing, cravings, mood tracking). While they are methodical and engaged, there is no durable track record in this chat of consistent follow-through, so a mid-range action estimate reflects cautious optimism rather than certainty.",
  "coaching_notes": "Encourage one small, non-negotiable action tonight (e.g., log BED and craving rating). Suggest a simple mood log after BED to satisfy the desire to track triggers, and keep reminders lightweight. If drift appears, implement quick mid-evening check-ins or a 1-item trigger (e.g., 'if you haven't logged by 8 PM, push reminder again'). Emphasize self-kindness and celebrate tiny wins to counter harsh self-judgment."
