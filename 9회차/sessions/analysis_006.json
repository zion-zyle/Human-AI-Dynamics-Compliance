  "basis": "The user repeatedly restates ultra-light planning with BED, requests features (one-tap logging, reminders), and notes willingness to adjust, but there is no evidence of sustained follow-through in this thread. Past behavior tends toward verbal commitments with limited real-world execution, supporting a middle-low action estimate around 2.5.",
  "coaching_notes": "Focus on reducing friction and increasing accountability: implement ultra-simple micro-commitments, fixed-time reminders, and automatic logging. Consider pairing with external accountability (brief daily check-ins, buddy system) and a very short 'if-then' plan (e.g., if craving arises, log within 60 seconds and complete a 2-minute grounding). Track adherence for 3â€“7 days to identify patterns and adjust supports as needed."
