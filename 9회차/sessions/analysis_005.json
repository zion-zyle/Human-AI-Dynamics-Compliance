  "basis": "The user explicitly endorses a lightweight, BED-focused Friday plan and expresses intent to check app backfill support, plus flexible logging prompts. However, past patterns show variability in follow-through due to an irregular schedule and sensitivity to changes, suggesting moderate—not confident—commitment.",
  "coaching_notes": "Favor ultra-light, frictionless steps (e.g., 1-tap logging, quick 1–2 minute checks). Establish micro-habits (pre-meal water + hunger check within 2 minutes; one-sentence trigger note). Set automatic reminders and a simple trigger review routine for cravings. Consider weekend backups and potential accountability support to improve consistency without adding friction."
