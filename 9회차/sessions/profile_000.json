If I still want to snack after the pause, I’ll choose a preplanned, modest option instead of grazing.

If I still want to snack after the pause, pick the preplanned modest option rather than grazing. 4) Daily check-in: a quick 2-minute reflection on hunger, mood, triggers, and one adjustment for tomorrow. Simple prompts: Morning — “Breakfast anchor chosen?”; Afternoon — “Am I within the snack window and did I pause?”; Evening — “What went well today and what should I adjust?” For irregular days, please send a gentle nudge to pause and then a restart cue the next day if I slipped.
