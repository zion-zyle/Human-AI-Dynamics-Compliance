Each option pairs a small protein with a fruit or veggie for fullness and quick prep:\n\n- Yogurt + berries: about 1 cup yogurt (Greek or regular) with a small handful of berries. Add a sprinkle of nuts if you have them.\n- Apple/pear + nut butter: 1 medium apple or pear sliced with 1 tablespoon peanut or almond butter.\n- Cottage cheese bowl: 1/2 cup cottage cheese with pineapple chunks or berries.\n- Hard-boiled egg + veggie: 1–2 hard-boiled eggs with cucumber slices or cherry tomatoes.\n- Cheese + fruit: 1 string cheese or 1–2 slices with apple slices or grapes.\n- Hummus + veggie sticks: 2 tablespoons hummus with carrot sticks, cucumber, or celery.\n- Tuna on cucumber rounds: 1 small spoonful of tuna salad on cucumber slices or a single cracker.\n- Edamame or tofu cubes: 1/2 cup shelled edamame or 4–6 bite-sized tofu cubes with a pinch of salt.\n\nIf you want, tell me what you have at home and I’ll tailor 2–3 exact combos with precise portions for tonight. After you snack, remember to log fullness and mood.\n",
