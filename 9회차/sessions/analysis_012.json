  "basis": "The user presents a concrete, multi-component plan (lite logs, backup lines, reminders, daily BED check-in, social meal strategies) and expresses willingness to adapt. However, given BED and irregular schedules, there remains a meaningful risk of lapse. With mid-range motivation and explicit coping strategies, a moderate action likelihood is most realistic.",
  "coaching_notes": "- Emphasize small, trackable wins tonight (e.g., complete the 60-second pause, log Start/Urge even if late). \n- Ensure easy back-ups (backup lines #2/#3) and a simple one-line end-of-day BED check-in to sustain momentum. \n- If schedule shifts, encourage adjusting reminders by small increments (e.g., Â±15-30 minutes) and using batch-logging when needed. \n- After tonight, review which triggers surfaced (especially around social meals) and refine reminder timing and backup lines accordingly. \n- Consider a quick post-meal reflection prompt to shorten friction (e.g., one sentence about urge and one takeaway)."
