    "agent_utterance": "Plan for 7:30–8:00 PM: start with a quick grounding (2 minutes) or 1–2 minute box-breathing, then have one small, pre-portioned snack with a tall glass of water (for example, berries with a small yogurt or an apple with a teaspoon of peanut butter). If cravings or hunger score reaches 3 or more, eat the pre-portioned snack slowly over 10–15 minutes. Afterward, jot a one-line note on what helped and what to tweak for tomorrow.",
    "agent_monologue": "Sorry, I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought. Brief rationale: it’s Friday evening in Suwon with hot weather (32°C), and the user has BED, so a short, low-effort plan is best. A clearly defined 7:30–8:00 PM window with grounding, hydration, and a pre-portioned snack aligns with their coaching notes and supports consistent adherence while reducing grazing risk.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan sounds doable tonight. I like the grounding and a small pre-portioned snack with water. I’ll aim for berries with a little yogurt or an apple with a teaspoon of peanut butter, and I’ll eat it slowly over 10–15 minutes. If a craving hits 3 or higher, I’ll pause and use the slow-eating approach, then log a quick one-line note about what helped and what to tweak for tomorrow. Quick questions: what if I’m not hungry at 7:30–8:00—can I move the snack earlier or skip it? If I don’t have berries or yogurt, would carrots with hummus or a small cheese stick be okay? Any extra tips for handling late-evening urges beyond the snack?"

    "agent_utterance": "Great questions. Here are concise, practical responses for tonight:\n\n- If you’re not hungry at 7:30–8:00: you can either move the snack earlier (e.g., 7:00–7:20) or skip it. If you skip, use a quick non-food strategy (hydration, 2 minutes of box-breathing, or a 5–10 minute light walk) and recheck hunger/craving in 15–20 minutes. The aim is to respond to appetite, not force a snack.\n\n- Substitutes: carrots with hummus or a small cheese stick are fine options. For portions, try about 1 cup carrot sticks with 1–2 tablespoons hummus, or one standard cheese stick (~28 g).\n\n- Extra tips for late-evening urges: \n  - Hydrate (water or non-sugary tea) and review dinner protein intake. \n  - Have a simple wind-down routine (brush teeth, warm beverage, light stretching) to reduce evening grazing cues. \n  - Create a small kitchen-rule (e.g., no snacks after a certain time, or put snacks away in a container). \n  - If cravings persist, log a quick note on triggers and try a brief urge-surfing exercise, then reassess hunger before bedtime.\n\nWould you like me to tailor a specific 7:00–9:00 PM window with exact backup options based on what you have at home tonight?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: evenings can feel demanding, and giving you flexible timing with simple substitutes reduces decision fatigue and grazing. The goal is to keep you in control without mandating eating when not hungry.",
    "user_utterance": "Appreciate the flexibility. If I’m not hungry at 7:30–8:00, I’ll either move the snack to 7:00–7:20 or skip and do a quick non-food reset (water, 2 minutes box-breath, or a short 5–10 minute walk) and recheck hunger in 15–20 minutes. Carrots with hummus or a small cheese stick are good backups (e.g., 1 cup carrot sticks with 1–2 tbsp hummus, or one cheese stick). For late-evening urges I’ll hydrate, have a simple wind-down, and consider a light kitchen rule. Could we add a 1–2 minute urge-surfing script I can use tonight?
