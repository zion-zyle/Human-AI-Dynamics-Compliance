    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: it's a hot Friday evening in Suwon (32°C), which can heighten fatigue and craving signals. The user prefers small, actionable steps and has BED. So I’m proposing a short, low-effort 4-step plan that can be done indoors, supports hunger/distress management, and uses a quick log—matching a moderate action target (roughly 3–4 steps). This keeps momentum without overwhelming them.",
