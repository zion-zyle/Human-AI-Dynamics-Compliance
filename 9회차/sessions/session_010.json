    "agent_utterance": "Tip for staying consistent on off-days and moving toward a regular meal pattern:\n\n- Create 3 flexible meal anchors: aim for roughly every 4–5 hours. Pick times that you can adjust if your day shifts (e.g., around 8–9 am, 1–2 pm, 6–8 pm). If you wake later, shift the anchors accordingly but keep spacing similar.\n- Prep simple, enjoyable options you can grab quickly (protein + fiber): yogurt with fruit, eggs or egg substitute, canned tuna or chicken with veggies, whole-grain wraps, a ready-made salad with a protein. Keep a small, grab-and-go kit at home or work.\n- Reduce logging friction on busy days: use 1-tap logging or a short, two-field log (meal and hunger level). Set 1–2 reminders (e.g., “Log now” and “Pause before bite”). If you truly can’t log, log later in a batch (a quick note about the meal and mood).\n- Plan for binge-urge moments: pause for 2 minutes, drink water, do a 5-minute calm break, then log as soon as you can. If you binge, log what you ate and your hunger/mood as soon as you feel able, and reflect on triggers afterward.\n- Introduce a regular meal pattern gradually:\n  - Start with 3 meals + 1 snack most days, with approximate times you can hold on typical days.\n  - Ensure each meal includes a protein source and fiber (helps fullness and mood stability).\n  - Once you’re consistently hitting this 4–5 days a week, add a second daily snack if you want more stability.\n- On hot days (Suwon, 32°C): hydrate early, choose lighter meals, and keep portable snacks easy to access. If energy drops, opt for small, cold or room-temp meals rather than heavy options.\n- On off-days, give yourself grace: aim for “good enough” consistency rather than perfection. If a day gets shifted, re-anchor the next meal as soon as you can and carry the micro-habit forward.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: a hot Friday afternoon can sap energy and make adherence harder, and a disrupted schedule increases forgetfulness around logging.

I’ll emphasize flexibility, low logging friction, and simple anchors to ride out off-days.",

Examples: \n  - Protein: small tuna pouch, hard-boiled egg, cheese stick, a protein bar, or yogurt cup\n  - Fiber: apple, pear, a handful of baby carrots, or a fiber-rich bar\n  - Hydration: 500 ml water bottle (add electrolyte tabs if available)\n- Use 3 flexible meal anchors (adjust times as needed): roughly within 4–5 hour spacing (e.g., 8–9 am, 1–2 pm, 6–8 pm)\n- Quick 2-field log (minimal friction): log once you eat (Meal: Yes/No) and rate hunger 1–5 (optional mood). If you can’t log right away, jot a one-liner later.\n- Pause-then-choose rule: before each bite during the day, pause for 2 minutes, drink water, then choose from your grab options if possible.\n- Re-anchor after a disruption: as soon as you’re back on track, select the next anchor time and plan a simple option from your kit.\n\nTemplates you can use (printable or save on your phone)\n\nTemplate A: Away-from-home Plan Card\n- Anchors (times you can shift): 8–9 am, 1–2 pm, 6–7 pm\n- Grab options (protein + fiber, ready to grab):\n  - Option 1: tuna pouch + apple\n  - Option 2: hard-boiled egg + carrot sticks\n  - Option 3: yogurt cup + berries\n  - Option 4: cheese stick + whole-grain cracker\n  - Option 5: protein bar + fruit\n- Hydration: 500 ml water now + optional electrolyte tab\n- Log method: 2 fields — Meal (Yes/No) and Hunger (1–5). Mood optional.\n- Quick re-anchor cue: if you miss an anchor, set the next upcoming anchor and prep a grab option from the list.\n\nTemplate B: Quick Log Sheet (text you can print or screenshot)\nDate/Time:\nLocation:\nMeal/Snack (what you ate):\nHunger 1–5:\nMood (optional):\nNotes (triggers, context):\n\nTemplate C: On-the-go 1-page template (fill once, reuse)\n- Today’s anchors: [write shifted times here]\n- Portable options: [list your 3–4 grab options]\n- Log plan: [Yes/No], Hunger (1–5), Mood\n- Re-anchor rule: when you’re back, set the next anchor and prep the next grab option\n\nTips for staying consistent away from home\n- Keep the kit in an easy-access bag or car console so you don’t forget it.\n- Use 1-tap reminders or a short note on your phone to prompt logging after meals.\n- If you truly can’t log at the moment, log a quick note later with meal type and hunger/mood.\n- Hydration comes first: start with water, then choose the protein+fiber option.\n- Build in flexibility: if a planned anchor time shifts, log at the closest anchor and keep the spacing roughly 4–5 hours.\n\nIf you want, tell me the typical places you visit away from home (work, travel, gym, cafes) and I can tailor these templates to fit those environments.\n",
