A tiny, fixed anchor that connects to logging reduces decision fatigue and supports consistency without adding effort. This aligns with your plan for a brief pre/post-log routine and a simple reward.",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. I like the idea of anchoring a quick 2-minute routine around dinner or right after, so I’ll aim for about 6:15 PM. I can do the water, the 60-second breathing, and log hunger, urge, and mood in one line, plus the small non-food activity. My worries are evenings when I’m pulled in many directions and I might skip logging. If I forget, is it okay to log within 15–20 minutes after a meal or later in the evening? And if the breathing feels tight, can I adjust to a gentler pace (for example inhale 3s, hold 3s, exhale 5s)? I’ll try this tonight and keep track of how it goes over the next two weeks."

Do this in about 2 minutes and log in one line plus a quick non-food activity:\n\n- 1) Drink a glass of water\n- 2) Breathing: 60 seconds at a comfortable pace. If it ever starts to feel tight, switch to a gentler pace like inhale 3s, hold 3s, exhale 5s (or 2-2-4).\n- 3) Log in one line: Hunger level | Urge level | Mood (for example: Hunger 3, Urge 2, Mood Calm)\n- 4) Quick non-food activity: 1–2 minutes of light stretch or a short walk\n\nIf you forget, it’s perfectly okay to log within 15–20 minutes after a meal or later that evening. The goal is to capture it when you can, so set a gentle reminder if helpful (e.g., a 6:15 PM alert or a post-dinner note).\n\nTips for busy evenings:\n- Keep water, your log prompt, and a small note about your breathing pace within easy reach.\n- Consider a one-line log template you can copy quickly: Hunger X | Urge Y | Mood Z.\n- If the first nights feel off, try a shorter micro-step: water + 1 minute of breathing + one-line log + 1 minute stretch.\n\nTwo-week plan: aim for at least 4 evenings with the full routine. After a week, we’ll review what felt easiest and tweak timing or pace as needed. Want me to give you a ready-to-copy log template for tonight?",
