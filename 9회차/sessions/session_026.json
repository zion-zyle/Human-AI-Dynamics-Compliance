Here’s a quick, low-effort plan: 1) drink 250–300 ml of cold water or iced tea now and pause for 5 minutes. 2) if you still feel hungry, choose a tiny, pre-portioned snack such as 1 small apple (about 70–90 kcal) or 1 cup of air-popped popcorn (about 100 kcal). 3) during the pause, do 1 minute of box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4) to reset urges. If possible, add a 2-minute light stretch or short outdoor walk to move energy and beat the heat. This keeps momentum with small, sustainable steps tailored to today’s context.",

If still hungry, choose one backup snack from above and keep portions gentle. Remember: aim for nourishment and self-kindness, not punishment, especially with BED and hot weather.
