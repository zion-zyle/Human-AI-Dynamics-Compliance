  "basis": "The user consistently affirms Template A and the micro-habit, intends to pre-select defaults, and is asking for additional templates and reminder cadences, which signals commitment but also awareness of potential barriers (binge logging, social/travel days). This points to moderate-to-well-intended action rather than guaranteed execution.",
  "coaching_notes": "Aggressive simplification can improve uptake: lock in 2–3 crisp prompts (anchors, one default grab per environment, one-word binge log). Add event templates for common social settings (restaurant dining, coffee shop, group activity) and a simple reminder cadence around anchors. Propose a brief check-in after 3–4 days to adjust templates and confirm which day went well. Encourage batch logging as a safety net and consider pairing with an accountability buddy or reminder apps to boost consistency."
