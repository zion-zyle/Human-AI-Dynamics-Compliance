Given my BED and irregular eating, I want a simple, concrete step I can actually stick to: when the urge hits, I’ll pause for a minute, drink a glass of water, and wait 5 minutes. If I’m still hungry after that, I’ll have a planned, balanced snack (like an apple with a small handful of nuts) and log it right away. I’ll aim for three meals plus one planned snack, and I’ll note any external triggers so we can adjust. If a binge happens anyway, I’ll treat it as feedback and we’ll tweak the plan."
