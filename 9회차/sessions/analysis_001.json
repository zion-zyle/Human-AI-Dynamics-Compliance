  "basis": "The user repeatedly articulates plans and journaling prompts, but prior behavior shows a tendency toward verbal agreement without consistent follow-through. Even with acknowledging slips and requesting coping strategies, there is limited evidence of commitment to sustained, observable actions. Therefore, a modest action value (2.5) aligns with historical patterns of cautious engagement rather than reliable execution.",
  "coaching_notes": "To improve alignment, invite concrete micro-commitments (e.g., 'tonight I will do the 3-minute check-in exactly once at 9:00 PM'), set a specific trigger for action, and add accountability (brief check-in tomorrow). Explore barriers (emotional load, busy evenings, BED-specific flare-ups) and consider structured supports (short, scheduled reminders, brief follow-up, or a buddy system). Reinforce nonjudgmental framing, but pair it with small, trackable steps and rapid feedback to build momentum."
