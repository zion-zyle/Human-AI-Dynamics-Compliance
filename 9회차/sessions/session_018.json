    "agent_utterance": "Ultra-simple plan for today: set one daily reminder at a consistent time (e.g., 7 PM) to log one item you ate and how you felt today. Keep it to one item to minimize effort. If you miss a day, just log the next day—slips happen and it's okay. Also sip water or a cool drink to stay hydrated in the heat. If you have a moment, a 5-minute gentle breathing or a brief walk after dinner can help you unwind.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: it's Friday afternoon on a hot day, and the user has BED with moderate emotional sensitivity. A small, low-friction action (one daily reminder plus a quick log) aligns with their preference for gradual steps and helps sustain momentum without triggering overwhelm. Including a hydration note fits the weather context and supports mood/energy.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan sounds doable—thanks. A 7 PM reminder to log one item I ate and how I felt feels simple enough to start, and I appreciate that it doesn’t add extra pressure. I do worry that logging only one item might miss patterns on binge days, so I’d like to also note any urges or the context around meals when I log. I’ll aim to keep the daily log consistent, and if I miss a day I’ll just pick it up the next day without judgment. Hydration and a short post-dinner breath or walk feel helpful, and I might adjust the reminder time if my evening schedule shifts."

    "agent_utterance": "Great plan. To capture patterns without adding effort, keep your 7 PM daily log and add two ultra-brief prompts when you log: 1) a one-line note on any urge or trigger around that meal, and 2) a one-line context note (where you were, who you were with, or what was happening). Example: 'Item: apple; Urge: mild snack urge before dinner; Context: at home after work.' You can also include a mood rating if you like (e.g., 0-10) and remember to stay hydrated and do a brief 5-minute post-dinner breath or short walk. If your evening shifts, adjust the reminder time accordingly. If you miss a day, simply pick up the next day—no judgment.",
    "agent_monologue": "Concise rationale: in Suwon's hot Friday evening, the user benefits from keeping logging simple while adding two ultra-brief fields to capture urges and meal context. This enriches data for pattern detection without overloading the task, aligns with their preference for small steps, and allows flexibility if the evening schedule shifts.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan makes sense. I like adding urges and meal context to the daily log so I can spot patterns without feeling overwhelmed. I’ll keep the 7 PM log and use two ultra-brief prompts after each item: 1) Urge or trigger around the meal, 2) Context (where I was, who I was with, what was happening). I might add a quick mood rating if that feels useful. I’ll stick with hydration and the short post-dinner breath or walk, and I’ll adjust the reminder time if my evening shifts. If I miss a day, I’ll pick up the next day without judgment."

    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the starter—I like having a concrete example. I’ll start today with the 7 PM log and the two ultra-brief prompts, and I’ll try adding an urge intensity (0-10) since that could help spot patterns. I’ll keep mood and hydration optional at first and only add them if it feels useful. If logging starts to feel like pressure, I’ll pare it back to item, urge, and context.
