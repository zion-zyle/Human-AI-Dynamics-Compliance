  "basis": "The user repeatedly restates plans with fixed cues and supportive steps, but past behavior suggests mixed follow-through and a tendency to revert to flexible behavior rather than consistent action. The verbal commitment is moderate but not strongly predictive of sustained action.",
  "coaching_notes": "Address the gap between intention and action by adding concrete, low-friction supports: automated reminders with one-click actions, accountability checks, and habit stacking (linking the check-in to an existing nightly routine). Explore barriers (anxiety, binge urges, time shifts) and tailor micro-commitments and quick wins (e.g., 30-second pre-check-in, water-first ritual) to improve adherence."
