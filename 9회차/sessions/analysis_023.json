  "basis": "The user consistently demonstrates planning, explicit check-ins, and commitment to micro-actions (7:30–8:00 PM check-in, pre-portioned backups, hydration, grounding/box-breathing). While they’ve shown strong engagement, actual adherence depends on real-time factors like evening fatigue and grazing tendencies. A 4.0 reflects solid likelihood of following through with the plan, but not guaranteed 100%.",
  "coaching_notes": "Suggestions: set an explicit, unavoidable reminder for the 7:30–8:00 PM window (calendar alert or phone reminder). Use concrete prompts for grounding (two ready options: 5-4-3-2-1 grounding and 1–2 minute box-breathing sequence). Reinforce an if-then rule for grazing (if cravings ≥3 or hunger ≥3, choose a pre-portioned backup and eat slowly; else, 5–10 minutes of easy movement). Consider a brief post-check-in reflection to capture what worked and what needs tweaking, and adjust reminders/S strategies as needed."
