A tiny, highly doable action—hydration—fits a BED-supportive approach and gives you a reliable micro-goal to complete tonight.",
    "user_utterance": "That latest 2.33 feels pretty gentle, which I appreciate. Because of BED and my irregular eating, I want a single, doable step today. Can we try a 5-minute urge pause plus a glass of water before deciding what to eat? If the urge sticks around, I'll choose one pre-portioned option and log it. Starting small seems more doable for me right now—is that okay, or should we adjust the pause length or the snack option?"

    "agent_utterance": "Yes—let's try a 5-minute urge pause plus a glass of water. Here's a simple, doable workflow for today: 1) Set a timer for 5 minutes. 2) Drink 200–250 ml of water now. 3) When the timer ends, reassess the urge. If the urge has subsided, you can proceed without a snack or log that choice. If the urge sticks around, choose one pre-portioned option from this quick list: a) 1 medium apple or 1 cup berries, b) 125–150 g single-serving yogurt, c) a small handful of nuts (about 15–20 almonds), d) 1 rice cake with a thin spread of peanut butter. 4) Log the snack in the app with approximate quantity. 5) Briefly note how you felt and any environmental factors (like heat) that influenced you. If 5 minutes feels too long today, we can adjust to 3 or 7 minutes. How does that sound?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: a 5-minute urge pause with water is a low-friction, BED-friendly micro-step that can reduce impulsive snacking, especially on a hot Friday evening when fatigue and cravings may be higher. If 5 minutes feels long today, we can offer 3 or 7 minutes; the core idea is to pause, hydrate, and then decide. This aligns with the user's preference for starting small.",
    "user_utterance": "I appreciate the plan and I want to keep it simple today. A 5-minute urge pause with a glass of water feels doable, but since my eating is irregular, I’d like a little flexibility: if 5 minutes feels like too long, can we use 3 minutes instead (and we can try 7 if it felt easy later)? I also like having the pre-portioned snack options, and for today I’d probably choose berries or yogurt (125–150 g) depending on how hungry I am, or I’ll just log no snack if the urge subsides. I’ll log what I choose and note how I felt, plus the heat today as a possible factor."
