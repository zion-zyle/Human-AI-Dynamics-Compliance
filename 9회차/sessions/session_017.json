    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: Given hot weather, a Friday late-afternoon timing, and BED with moderate emotional sensitivity, a micro, ultra-tangible plan reduces decision fatigue and supports consistency. The suggested action aligns with a mid-range 2–3 step approach: hydration, a tiny pre-planned snack, and a quick log, keeping things simple and doable.",
    "user_utterance": "I appreciate how small and doable this is. For BED, tiny steps beat big, scary changes. I’ll try the 500 ml water plus a small snack I actually enjoy (like yogurt with berries or an apple and a few almonds). I’ll do the 10-second check-in before snacking and then log how hungry I am, my mood, and fullness after the snack. I’ll aim to fill meals with half veggies, a quarter protein, a quarter carbs. If I’m not hungry, I’ll skip the snack but still do the check-in. If I binge later, I’d like a quick reset instead of judging myself. Can we add a gentle reminder a couple times a day to start? If this feels off, I’d love to adapt it so it stays doable."

    "agent_utterance": "Wonderful idea. Here’s a simple, adaptable reminder setup you can start today:\n\n- Pick two reminder times (examples): 10:30 AM and 6:30 PM local time.\n- Reminder text you can use:\n  1) 10-second check-in: 'How hungry are you right now (0-10)? Do you want a snack? If yes, choose a small, enjoyable option (e.g., yogurt with berries or an apple + a few almonds) and drink 500 ml water.'\n  2) Before dinner/snack: 'Plate plan: half veggies, 1/4 protein, 1/4 carbs. If not hungry, you can skip the snack but log mood and fullness.'\n- Optional bing e reset prompt: 'If you binge later, pause for 2 minutes, breathe, then log—no judgments.'\n\nImplementation tips:\n- iPhone: Reminders app > New Reminder > set to repeat daily, paste the text.\n- Android: Use Google Calendar or a reminders app; paste the text as the reminder body.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the exact times to fit your routine or draft a ready-to-paste setup for your device. And if the reminders feel too much, we can dial back to one daily check-in or adjust the wording to feel even gentler.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: adding two gentle reminders aligns with your ultra-small-step approach, providing cueing without pressure and supporting BED-focused goals. Given the hot Friday afternoon in Suwon and your preference for doable steps, two short prompts around common activity windows are likely to be sustainable and adjustable. If these times don’t fit your routine, we can shift them or reduce to a single daily nudge.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that feels doable and reassuring. I’d like to start with one gentle reminder per day, maybe in the late afternoon when cravings tend to rise. I’ll keep the two-part check-in: a 10-second hunger check before meals or snacks, and a quick plate-plan reminder. If I’m not hungry, I’ll skip the snack but still log mood and fullness. The binge-reset prompt should stay gentle: pause for 2 minutes, breathe, and observe what’s happening without judging myself. If this ever feels like too much, we can dial back to one reminder or adjust the timing. Also, a small note to help with meals: aim for half veggies, 1/4 protein, 1/4 carbs where possible, and for snacks try to include a protein or fiber source (e.g., yogurt with berries and almonds). I’d appreciate the option to tweak times as my routine changes, especially on weekends."
