  "basis": "The user commits to a two-week test with an ultra-simple one-tap log, a light post-meal reminder, and a flexible weekly check-in. Their plan shows realistic, scalable steps and a willingness to adjust, which aligns with fairly consistent engagement in previous conversations. While there is some prior variability, the current intent is concrete and actionable.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain the ultra-simple log to minimize friction on chaotic days. Lean into the nightly 60-second reflection as a lightweight accountability nudge. Ensure protein-forward snack options remain accessible to support fullness. Encourage the user to keep a visible cue (reminders) and a flexible Sunday check-in. If consistency wavers, introduce small, specific prompts or micro-goals and revisit portions/trequency to fit real-life schedules."
