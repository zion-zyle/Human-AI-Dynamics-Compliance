  "basis": "The user reiterates a concrete plan and intent to log, with practical backup options and a hot-weather prep, which suggests moderate engagement. However, there is no guarantee of follow-through based on prior patterns; the stated plan aligns with a cautious, achievable target. The last suggestion (S = 2.37) and the 2.5 action level indicate modest expected adherence.",
  "coaching_notes": "Encourage micro-actions and immediate checkpoints tonight (e.g., place log in exact sight, set a timer for the 2-minute breathing). Use quick post-snack checks to confirm fullness decisions and log mood/hunger promptly to reinforce patterns. Consider a simple reminder system to improve consistency."
