Try these quick steps: 1) Do a 60-second hunger check before your next bite—am I truly hungry, or could thirst or boredom be the driver? If you’re not hungry, don’t eat; if you are, proceed with a small, balanced portion. 2) Log it with a single tap in the app (craving or meal). 3) Have a glass of water to hydrate and wait 2 minutes before deciding on the next bite. This trio takes under 3 minutes and minimizes friction.",
