    "agent_utterance": "I hear you—keeping it simple helps a lot when triggers show up. Could you share your top two triggers today and a small, predictable time window you could actually commit to for a regular meal?",
    "user_utterance": "Today was tough; a strong trigger pulled me off my usual routine, and I felt my glucose balance wobble. I want to stay committed and get back on track with a steadier plan."

    "agent_utterance": "You're doing well—let's keep it simple today. Pick one small, repeatable action to anchor meals: e.g., a protein+fiber breakfast within 60 minutes of waking, plus a brief snack if you feel hungry before lunch. Set a fixed mealtime window (e.g., 08:30–09:00) and stick to it. This steady step supports glucose balance without adding stress.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the guidance. I'll aim for regular, simple meals, especially when stress or triggers push me off track.",
