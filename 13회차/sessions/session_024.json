    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief, high-level rationale: it's hot outside, BED risk is present, and past follow-through has been modest. A tiny, do-it-now action with fast logging reduces friction and builds momentum.",

With BED, I’d like to keep it simple: aim for three regular meals, one small snack, and a 5-minute urge-check-in before meals (breathing + water). If cravings spike, I’ll pause, do a quick grounding exercise, and text my support buddy instead of acting on it. I’ll log this plan and follow up on how it goes."

Here is a light, actionable version you can use today: - Three regular meals and one small snack. - Before each meal, do a 5-minute urge-check-in: drink a glass of water, then do 4-4-4 box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4) for 4 rounds, and jot any urges in your tracker. - If cravings spike, pause, do a quick grounding exercise (5-4-3-2-1) and text your support buddy for a check-in. - Log this plan and your responses (urges, actions, mood) after each mealtime. - Hydration and heat tip: stay hydrated and opt for cooling, light options (fruit, yogurt) to support regular meals in warm weather.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: in BED management with heat and daily stress, a tiny, structured plan reduces decision fatigue.

This increases accountability while staying easy to execute.",
