  "basis": "The user explicitly accepts the flexible plan, commits to testing Wedâ€“Fri, and promises to share exact hours soon. Historically, they express strong intent but often delay providing concrete data or taking full follow-through until prompted. Given the current intent and repeated readiness to test, a mid-range action likelihood (around 3.0) is most realistic.",
  "coaching_notes": "Continue to prompt for exact hours promptly to lock in the final calendar. Reinforce the toggleable trigger-tracking and the single-line overruns log, keeping reminders encouraging. Consider adding a lightweight onboarding step (e.g., one-click hour submission) to reduce friction. Monitor for delays in sharing hours and offer a quick interim template with placeholders to maintain momentum."
