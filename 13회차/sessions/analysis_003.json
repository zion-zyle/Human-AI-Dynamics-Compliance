  "basis": "Past interactions show the user often verbalizes adherence to a simple plan (water and yogurt) but has a history of inconsistent follow-through with similar commitments. The final message repeats the plan and an intention to report back, but without clear evidence of reliable execution yet.",
  "coaching_notes": "Focus on reducing barriers to action by making steps as concrete and trackable as possible (e.g., exact timings, quick prompts). Use brief, frequent check-ins and acknowledge small wins to reinforce adherence. Address BED-related concerns by validating hunger cues and providing simple alternatives if cravings arise."
