If you miss a reminder, re-engage after the next meal—data, not guilt. With the heat, opt for lighter meals and avoid heavy fried options.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal reasoning, but here's a concise rationale: it's a hot Wednesday in Suwon and the user has BED with moderate mood sensitivity. A short, meal-linked, low-effort plan helps adherence when the day is warm and mood can shift. This aligns with reminders tied to meals and a simple printable template.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that plan feels doable. I’ll start by drinking more water now and with meals to stay hydrated and curb hunger spikes. For a BED-friendly snack, I’ll keep it simple and rotate between yogurt with berries and a small handful of nuts so I’m prepared when cravings hit. The one-page meal log after each meal sounds manageable—I'll print it and keep it by the fridge. If I miss a reminder, I’ll just re-engage after the next meal and focus on the pattern, not guilt. With the heat, I’ll aim for lighter meals like salads, soups, fruit, and grilled veggies. Could you share a couple of easy, travel-friendly snack ideas that don’t trigger binge urges? And any quick tips for late-night cravings?"
