    "agent_utterance": "Great plan. Here are concrete steps for the next few days, plus easy protein-rich snacks, and a compassionate reset if you slip.\n\nConcrete steps for the next 3 days\n- Daily structure (same pattern): 3 meals + a small protein-rich snack. Try roughly these times: Breakfast 8–9:00, Lunch 12:30–1:30, Dinner 6:30–7:30, Snack around 3:30–4:00. Adjust to your schedule.\n- Craving pause (5–10 minutes): When cravings hit, do: 1) Pause, 2) Sip 200–250 ml water, 3) Note the urge in your craving log, 4) Choose one quick action: a protein-containing snack, a short 5-minute walk, or a warm beverage.\n- Craving log (start today): keep a simple log with these fields: time, trigger (what felt stressful or tasty), urge rating 0–10, action taken, outcome. Review daily to spot patterns.\n- Hydration in heat: aim for about 2.2–2.5 L of water per day (more if you’re sweating a lot). Carry a bottle and sip regularly.\n- Simple prep and snack kit: pack a small, portable protein snack (see options below) for days out. Having it on hand reduces frictions during cravings.\n- Meal ideas (protein-forward, easy): grilled chicken breast, eggs, yogurt, tofu, tuna or sardines, edamame, cheese sticks, beans, lentils, or lean beef.\n\nEasy protein-rich snack options (quick and portable)\n- Dairy/eggs\n  - Greek yogurt (plain or with fruit) or a small tub of cottage cheese\n  - String cheese or a cheese stick\n  - Hard-boiled eggs (peeled, ready to grab)\n- Fish/meat\n  - Tuna or salmon pouches (in water) with crackers or cucumber slices\n  - Sliced turkey or chicken breast rolled with cucumber or cherry tomatoes\n- Plant-based bites\n  - Edamame (steamed in bag)\n  - Roasted chickpeas or soy nuts\n  - Hummus with carrot sticks, bell pepper strips, or rice crackers\n- Nuts and spreads\n  - A small handful of almonds, walnuts, or mixed nuts\n  - Apple or banana with peanut butter or almond butter\n- Quick shakes and bars (choose low-sugar options)\n  - Protein shake or ready-to-drink protein (look for 15–25 g protein, low sugar)\n  - Low-sugar protein bar (check fiber and sugar content)\n- Local-friendly ideas (easy to assemble in Korea)\n  - Tofu cubes with a splash of soy sauce and sesame seeds\n  - Kimchi or vegetable side with a boiled egg or tuna pouch\n  - Yogurt drink (yakult-style if you enjoy it) with nuts\n\nWhat to do if you slip or binge—reset without guilt\n1) Pause and acknowledge, then reframe: slipping happens. Treat it as data, not a moral flaw. Reconnect with your plan for the next moment.\n2) Immediate reset steps (first 15–20 minutes):\n   - Stop what you’re doing, put the trigger foods away if possible.\n   - Drink 1 glass of water (or herbal tea) and take a 2–3 minute box breathing pause to settle urges.\n   - Log the episode (time, what triggered it, urge rating, what you did next).\n3) Plan the next, smaller step: decide on a specific next meal or snack you’ll have, emphasizing protein and fiber to reduce subsequent cravings.\n4) Adjust your environment: remove or hide high-risk items, or move them to a less convenient spot. Have your portable snack kit ready.\n5) Self-kindness and practical self-talk: remind yourself, “One slip doesn’t erase progress. I’m resetting now and moving forward.”\n6) Analyze triggers later, not in the heat of the moment: were you stressed, sleep-deprived, or distracted? Use that insight to adjust your plan (e.g., add a short 5–10 minute de-stress routine after meals, or another protein-rich snack after dinner).\n7) Revisit the craving log at your next meal to see if patterns emerge (e.g., late-night cravings after certain foods or events) and adapt.\n\nOptional quick template to start today\n- Time:\n- Trigger:\n- Urge (0–10):\n- Action taken (pause, snack, walk, water):\n- Outcome:\n\nWould you like me to tailor these steps to your exact meal times or local grocery options?

Out-of-office meals: lean protein + vegetables; scan menus for protein-forward options; have a safe backup snack if protein isn’t available. Vegan/vegetarian or dairy/gluten-free guidance: edamame, hummus with veggies, tempeh, or a protein shake. Catch-all overruns: use one quick action from your backup kit and log in one line, e.g. 09:45 Trigger: meeting overrun; Urge: 6/10; Action: tuna pouch; Result: urge eased. Optional craving-log fields to toggle on/off: Sleep quality (1–5), Stress level (0–10), Caffeine today (cups), Alcohol today (units). Core anchors with buffers (tested for BED/irregular hours): Breakfast 9:00–9:30 (buffer ±1h), Lunch 12:30–13:30 (buffer ±1h), Snack 15:30–16:00 (buffer ±30m), Dinner 18:00–19:00 (buffer ±1h). Testing window: Wed–Fri; exact hours to be finalized once you share your schedule. Finalized 3-day calendar with encouraging reminders and an editable template you can reuse weekly will be provided as soon as you share your daily hours. Pro tip: keep the language supportive in reminders (e.g., “Nice work staying on track” rather than punitive phrasing).",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here’s a concise rationale: you’ve asked for a very practical, flexible plan that accounts for BED and irregular hours. I’ve incorporated 2–3 extra plant-based backups, kept the overruns log ultra-simple, added social/diet notes for out-of-office meals, and provided an optional toggle for tracking additional triggers. The plan remains lightweight and encouraging, with ready-to-use structure that can be finalized once you share exact hours.",
    "user_utterance": "This is really helpful—thank you for keeping the plan flexible and BED-friendly. The extra backups (roasted soy nuts, lentil snack, portable pea bar) plus the plant-based options and a quick bar feel practical, especially on rushed days. I also like the social/diet notes for out-of-office meals; they give me a clear approach without being restrictive. I’m ready to test Wed–Fri and will share my exact daily hours soon so you can finalize the 3-day calendar with encouraging reminders and an editable weekly template. I’m glad you offered optional trigger tracking (sleep, stress, caffeine, alcohol) and I’d love to toggle those on/off depending on how I’m feeling—could we implement that toggle? I’ll keep the one-line overruns log example in mind and stay focused on the simple catch-all. Looking forward to the finalized calendar."

If vegan/vegetarian or avoiding dairy/gluten, rely on edamame, hummus with veggies, tempeh, or a protein shake. 6) Toggle optional trigger tracking in your craving log (Sleep: on/off, Stress: on/off, Caffeine: on/off, Alcohol: on/off). 7) I’ll finalize the Wed–Fri calendar once you share your exact daily hours and provide an editable weekly template you can reuse.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share a detailed internal monologue, but here’s a concise rationale: with hot weather and BED plus irregular hours, the goal is to minimize cognitive load while preserving accountability. A simple hydration cue, a quick 5–10 minute pause with a one-line overruns log, and a single quick action keep momentum without stress. Social/out-of-office notes add practicality, and optional trigger tracking lets you adjust based on how you feel. This supports progress without becoming punitive.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for keeping it flexible and BED-friendly. I like the simple overruns log and the quick backup options—especially the plant-based + quick bar ideas. I’m ready to test Wed–Fri and I’ll share my exact hours soon so you can lock in the 3-day calendar and editable weekly template. I’m glad you included a toggle for the trigger tracking—Sleep, Stress, Caffeine, and Alcohol—so I can turn them on or off depending on how I’m feeling. A couple of quick questions: can we confirm that the overruns log will always be a single line, and can we ensure the reminders are encouraging rather than punitive? Also, once I share hours, please tailor the calendar to my actual schedule and include some guidance for social/out-of-office meals. Looking forward to trying this out."
