  "basis": "The user has repeatedly followed through with snack prep, hunger logging, coping strategies, and a bedtime routine across multiple interactions. Theyâ€™ve endorsed a lean, flexible plan, expressed willingness to adjust only when needed, and agreed to weekly tuning and morning catch-ups. This pattern indicates a higher likelihood of action, though there remains some variability on exact timing on busier days.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain ultra-simple prompts and flexible windows to reduce stress. Reinforce micro-goals (e.g., one task per day), and keep reminders reliable (phone push with a backup). If fatigue or schedule pressure arises, offer an even smaller default task and remind them about the morning catch-up. Monitor hydration cues especially in heat and encourage the exact snack log template to stay consistent."
