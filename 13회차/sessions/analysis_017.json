  "basis": "The user expresses strong intent and lays out concrete steps, but their history (as observed in prior conversations) shows a pattern of verbal commitment without consistent follow-through. They frequently set up plans and templates yet rely on motivation and external prompts to execute, indicating cautious optimism rather than reliable action.",
  "coaching_notes": "Focus on lowering barriers to action with micro-choices and concrete prompts. Use very small, time-constrained commitments (e.g., log within 2 minutes of finishing the snack, set a 1-minute reminder). Pair plans with accountability: share a brief daily log summary with a partner or use an automatic log capture. Simplify logistics (pre-packaged options, ready-to-use templates) and link logs to immediate small rewards to reinforce consistency."
