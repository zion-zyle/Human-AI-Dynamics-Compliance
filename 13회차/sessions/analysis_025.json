  "basis": "The user expresses commitment and adds practical safeguards (pre-meal check, evening boundary, flexible logging, sleep/stress notes). However, their historical pattern shows variability and occasional wobbles, with prior days where plans were adjusted or delayed. This suggests a mid-range likelihood of following through, not full, unwavering adherence.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain focus on concrete, small-step actions and quick check-ins. Emphasize triggers for BED and social meals, and encourage explicit if-then plans for chaotic days. Reinforce post-meal logging as a default to prevent backlog, and consider pairing urge-surf with a fast grounding activity during peak cravings. Track sleep/stress notes consistently to identify patterns."
