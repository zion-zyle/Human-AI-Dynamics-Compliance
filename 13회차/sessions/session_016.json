    "agent_utterance": "Here's a compact, today-friendly version with practical tweaks for irregular days:\n\na) Eat three meals with protein and fiber. If three full meals feel tough today, do two meals plus one protein-rich snack, ensuring each eating occasion includes protein and fiber (예: 아침에 계란+채소, 점심에 닭고기/두부 + 현미/채소, 저녁에 생선/콩류 + 퀴노아+채소; 간식으로 요거트나 견과류+과일 등).\n\nb) When a craving hits, pause for 5 minutes and take 3 slow breaths (inhale 4s, hold 2s, exhale 6s). If time is tight, do a quick 3-breath cycle and a brief 1-minute pause instead.\n\nc) Quick log: after the pause or after eating, jot one sentence about what you felt and what the urge was about.\n\nMidday trigger: set a reminder around 12:15–12:30 to log meals and mood. If you miss it, log as soon as you can.\n\nTweak ideas for irregular days:\n- Keep portable protein + fiber options handy (예: 삶은 달걀, 요거트, 견과류, 과일, 채소 스틱, 현미밥 소량).\n- If meals slip, bridge with a protein+fiber snack.\n- Short daily check-ins: one-line mood note and urge snapshot whenever you pause.\n- Stay hydrated: aim for water with meals and snacks.\n\nToday’s plan: choose your meal pattern (three meals or two meals + snack), prepare at least one portable protein+fiber item, set the midday reminder, and log afterward.",
    "agent_monologue": "Contextual factors: hot day in Suwon on a Wednesday; irregular schedule likely. To maximize adherence without overloading, provide a simple three-step framework (meals, craving pause, quick reflection) with flexible tweaks for imperfect days. This keeps focus on protein+fiber at meals, a brief craving pause, and a quick mood/urge log, which is appropriate for BED management and habit formation.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the practical tweaks. I think I’ll start with two meals plus a protein/fiber snack when needed, since three meals can be tough on days with irregular patterns.

I’ll set a midday log reminder around 12:15–12:30 and log meals and mood as soon as I can if I miss it. For cravings, I’ll pause 5 minutes and take 3 slow breaths; if I’m pressed for time, I’ll do a quick 3-breath cycle and a brief pause. After the pause or eating, I’ll jot one sentence about what I felt and what the urge was about. If I slip, I’ll treat it as feedback and practice self-compassion instead of guilt. I’d love any quick, BED-friendly snack ideas and a simple self-talk script I can use after urges. Also let me know if there’s a way to adjust the plan on ultra-busy days."

Simple self-talk after urges (try one quick version): 'Craving, I hear you. You’re temporary. I’ll pause, take 3 slow breaths, and choose a protein+fiber snack to nourish my body. This feeling will pass, and I’m in control.' If you’re in a rush: 'Pause, breathe, and do a quick snack or short walk. I’ve got this.' Ultra-busy-day adjustments: pre-pack snacks and keep them visible; aim for two meals + a snack, with one micro-check-in after meals; if nothing else is possible, do a 3-breath cycle and log later with one sentence; a quick protein shake or yogurt can stand in for a meal; use simple reminders (one midday log, and a secondary quick-urge reminder if feasible).
