    "user_utterance": "That micro-action sounds doable. I will pause for 60 seconds whenever I notice hunger and ask myself if I am genuinely hungry. If yes, I will grab a small, portable option (like an apple or yogurt) and log it. If I am not hungry, I will drink a glass of water, take two slow breaths, and note how full I feel.
