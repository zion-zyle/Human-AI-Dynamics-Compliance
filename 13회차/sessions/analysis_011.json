  "coaching_notes": "To boost compliance, propose concrete micro-steps with fixed times, add environmental cues (e.g., set a reminder alarm, place water bottle and snack near easy reach), and use a simple trackable trigger-coping checklist. Schedule brief daily check-ins and consider a commitment device (e.g., share plan with a friend or set a small reward)."
