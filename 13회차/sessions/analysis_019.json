  "basis": "The user explicitly commits to practical steps (pre-portioning tomorrow's snacks, placing reminders by phone/bedside, and using an ultra-short nightly check-in) and contingencies for exhaustion. This shows concrete planning and intent, which aligns with moderate-high action likelihood. However, given historical variability in follow-through on longer routines, the action value remains cautious rather than certainty.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain micro-commitments and visible cues to support adherence. Encourage quick log-ins after each snack or wind-down, and regular check-ins on obstacles (fatigue, time, stress). Consider reinforcing environment design (pre-portioning, placing bags in sight) and optional prompts to reduce decision fatigue on busy days. Acknowledge progress to sustain motivation and address barriers promptly."
