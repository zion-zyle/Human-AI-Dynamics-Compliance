If cravings arise, pause for 2 minutes of slow breathing and then choose the smallest acceptable option. We'll review progress at your morning catch-up tomorrow.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: It's hot in Suwon (32°C) on a Wednesday morning, which raises hydration needs and can spike urges. The user has shown openness to ultra-simple micro-goals and consistent snack logging. So I chose two tiny steps that are quick to start now and support hydration and urge management. The plan aligns with a lean daily window and reliable reminders.",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. I'll start by grabbing a tall glass of water now. For the snack, I'll log a small option like yogurt with berries or a small handful of nuts and note the portion I can finish. If cravings flare, I'll pause for 2 minutes of slow breathing and then pick the smallest acceptable bite. I know with BED I might slip, but keeping this light and specific helps. I'll aim to stay consistent today and we can review tomorrow morning."
