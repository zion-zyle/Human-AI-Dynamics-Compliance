Here’s a simple, doable plan: 1) drink a large glass of water now (about 350–500 ml). 2) have an easy protein breakfast (yogurt with fruit, or eggs with toast). 3) do a quick 7–10 minute walk in the shade or a short indoor stretch to reset. 4) set a slip plan: if a lapse happens later, restart at the next meal and choose one small action (e.g., add a protein snack). 5) do a 2-minute check-in later today to confirm you completed at least one action. Small, steady steps fit the heat, support BED, and reduce decision fatigue without judgment.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise factor-based summary: it’s a hot Wednesday morning in Suwon (32°C) with BED and moderate stress sensitivity.

The plan emphasizes hydration, a quick protein-containing breakfast, light movement, a slip/reset strategy, and a brief accountability check-in to support consistency without overthinking.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable. I'll start now with a big glass of water, keep breakfast simple, and fit in a short walk.
