  "basis": "Historically, the user offers verbal commitment but shows limited follow-through in practice. In this thread, they repeatedly outline plans and preferences without reporting concrete actions taken, suggesting a modest likelihood of actual execution today.",
  "coaching_notes": "Use micro-commitments and brief check-ins to boost accountability (e.g., commit to one concrete action now and a brief progress report). Consider reminders, brief urge-note prompts, and an extremely lightweight tracking routine to reduce friction. Pairing with an accountability buddy or therapist support could help sustain consistency."
