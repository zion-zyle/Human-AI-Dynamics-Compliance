    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: it's a hot Wednesday morning in Suwon and the user has BED with moderate stress sensitivity. A tiny, fixed micro-step that includes hydration and a small protein snack, plus a quick check-in cue, is most likely to be followed and help prevent overeating later. This aligns with using concrete steps, environmental cues, and brief daily check-ins to boost compliance.",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. I’ll start with a 250 ml glass of water and a small protein snack today, and I’ll place them where I’ll see them. I’ll set a 30‑minute check‑in and try to rate my hunger on a 0–10 scale. For my BED, keeping things simple helps, especially in hot weather. I’m a bit worried about late‑afternoon urges, so could we add a quick check‑in around 3–4 pm and include a couple of low‑effort swap options (like fruit, yogurt, or a handful of nuts) if I’m craving but not truly hungry? It would also help if reminders are easy to use (one tap) and I can adjust them if my day gets busy."
