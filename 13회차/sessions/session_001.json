My eating is a bit irregular, and I tend to binge when things feel out of control, so a 250–300 ml glass of water plus a small protein snack could help with fullness. I’ll try it today: if I’m not hungry, I’ll just drink water and recheck after 2 minutes; if I’m hungry, I’ll choose something simple like plain yogurt with berries, a boiled egg, or almonds. I haven’t acted on the last few suggestions yet—could we set a tiny 2-day plan with reminders and a quick 5-minute mid-morning check-in to adjust? Also, any other non-restrictive snack ideas to help manage urges would be great."

Here’s a simple 2-day plan with reminders and a 5-minute mid-morning check-in to adjust, plus a list of non-restrictive snack ideas to manage urges.\n\nPlan at a glance:\n- Day 1 (Today):\n  - 9:00 AM: Take 1 large glass of water (250–300 ml) and, if still hungry after a couple of minutes, have a small protein snack (e.g., plain yogurt with berries, a boiled egg, or almonds). If not hungry, wait 2 minutes and re-check.\n  - 11:00 AM: 5-minute mid-morning check-in. Note hunger level (0–10), mood, and any triggers; decide if you want a light snack now or later, and adjust your plan for the rest of the day accordingly.\n  - 3:00 PM (optional): A quick micro-habit if cravings surge (water + small protein bite) to reset.\n- Day 2 (Tomorrow):\n  - 9:00 AM: Repeat the 9:00 AM water + optional protein snack (or just water if not hungry).\n  - 11:00 AM: 5-minute check-in as on Day 1.\n  - 3:00 PM (optional): Optional micro-habit if needed.\n\nReminders to set (phone or calendar):\n- Day 1: 8:55 AM prep reminder, 9:00 AM start, 11:00 AM check-in\n- Day 2: 8:55 AM prep reminder, 9:00 AM start, 11:00 AM check-in\n\nNon-restrictive snack ideas to manage urges:\n- Plain yogurt with berries\n- Boiled egg with cucumber\n- Apple slices with peanut butter\n- A handful of almonds or walnuts\n- Cottage cheese with pineapple or berries\n- Hummus with carrot or cucumber sticks\n- Air-popped popcorn (small serving)\n- Edamame\n- String cheese or a cheese stick\n- Rice cake with avocado and tomato\n- Tuna on crackers or a small tuna packet with crackers\n- Protein smoothie or shake (light serving)\n\nTips: stay hydrated in the heat, keep the plan flexible, practice self-compassion, and use urges as signals to re-fuel rather than punishments.",
