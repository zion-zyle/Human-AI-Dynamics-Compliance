If the urge remains after 10 minutes, repeat the log. Keep a bottle of water nearby and aim for steady hydration in the heat.",

    "user_utterance": "That plan sounds doable. I’ll pick a fixed cue (like 9:00 AM) and start by logging any urge and rating it 0–5.

As someone with BED and irregular meals, I might also benefit from extra coping steps for high-urge moments (urge surfing, a brief walk, or a non-food distraction).

Afterward, log again and postpone any eating by 15 minutes before deciding on the next micro-action. If the urge stays strong, repeat the micro-action and consider a quick check-in with someone you trust for accountability. Weekend or hot-day adjustments: consider shifting your fixed cue to 8:30–8:45 AM or adding a second check-in in the afternoon (around 3:30–4:00 PM).
