Communicate portions where you can (less rice, more greens) to help hit your target.\n- Extra morning strategies: in addition to water and a small protein bite, start with a protein-rich breakfast (e.g., 2 eggs with veggies, or 150 g Greek yogurt with berries) plus fiber (oats/fruit). Add a 2–3 minute box-breathing or a 5-minute light movement right after waking to curb urges.

Maintain Sunday reset as a fallback if the weekend is especially chaotic.\n- Quick morning tip to prevent morning urges: hydrate well, have a protein-rich breakfast, and add a brief 2-minute urge-surf or a short 5-minute movement break to set a steadier tone before lunch.\n- Weekend defaults: keep fixed backup snack, a 5-minute bridge, and the 7–8 PM check-in, adjusting times as needed.\n- Quick follow-up plan: if social meals or weekend shifts happen, review protein hits and logs at the 7–8 PM check-in and tweak tomorrow’s targets accordingly.",

Could we add a small, portable protein booster (like a bit of tuna, a yogurt cup, or a protein bar) or a simple rule to aim for at least 20–25 g protein within the meal or its sides? If that’s not possible, I’ll add a protein-rich snack on the side. 2) Extra morning strategies: I like the breakfast ideas, but some mornings are chaotic. If I wake late, a quick portable option (protein shake, hard-boiled egg, or yogurt) plus a 2-minute urge-surf would help set the tone. 3) If weekends are chaotic: sliding the lunch window by 30–60 minutes is fine, and I’ll still log cravings, mood, and meals.
