  "basis": "The user provides a concrete, multi-step plan and notes being on edge, suggesting cautious engagement. However, prior patterns in the conversation show a tendency toward verbal commitment without consistent follow-through. With S = 2.53, a mid-range action (around 2.5) reflects plausible but not strong adherence given mixed history and current stress.",
  "coaching_notes": "Encourage micro-commitments and simple accountability (e.g., quick post-break log, a single reminder). Explore concrete barriers (cravings, social situations, travel). Offer quick, low-friction options tailored to away-from-home contexts and confirm that they can report back after attempts to adjust plans, which may improve actual adherence over time."
