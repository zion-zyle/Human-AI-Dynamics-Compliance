    "agent_utterance": "Here's your quick, doable plan for this Wednesday: After you finish your next snack, log it in your tracking app within 2 minutes. To make it easy, choose a ready-to-use portioned option today, such as (a) 1 small cup of yogurt with a few berries, or (b) a handful of almonds with a small apple. Set a 1-minute reminder on your phone to prompt you to log. Keep a bottle of water handy to stay hydrated in the 32°C heat in Suwon. If you’re not ready to log right away, you can log the snack you actually ate and reflect briefly on how it felt.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: Today's hot weather in Suwon and the BED pattern suggest that the easiest path to consistency is a micro-commitment with minimal friction. Logging within 2 minutes after eating reduces delay and reliance on motivation, and pairing it with a ready-to-use, portion-controlled snack minimizes decision fatigue and impulsive eating.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable. I’ll go with the ready-to-use portions—yogurt with berries or almonds with a small apple—so I don’t have to decide in the moment. Logging within 2 minutes after I snack sounds helpful, and I’ll set a 1-minute reminder. I’ll keep water handy in this heat. If I’m not ready to log, I’ll at least note what I ate and how it felt. My worry is slipping into all-or-nothing thinking if logging gets hard; can we also include a quick coping cue (like a 4-4-4 breathing or a brief stretch) to use before I binge or during cravings?"
  },
  {
    "turn": 2,
    "agent_utterance": "Nice plan. Add a coping-cue layer to interrupt urges and keep action ultra-simple. Choose one cue and use it at the first sign of craving or before a binge attempt: 1) 4-4-4 breathing for 60 seconds (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4); 2) a brief 30-second full-body stretch (neck, shoulders, arms, calves); 3) a 2-minute brisk walk or march in place. After using the cue, proceed with your ready-to-use snack option (yogurt with berries or almonds with a small apple) and log within 2 minutes. If you’re not ready to log, quickly note what you ate and how you felt. Hydrate throughout the heat (32°C). Remember, aim for micro-commitments rather than perfection—the next small step is what matters.",
    "agent_monologue": "I'm sorry, but I can't share my internal chain-of-thought. Here's a concise rationale instead: cravings can spike with heat and routine disruption, so adding a quick coping cue helps interrupt urges and supports micro-choices, reducing all-or-nothing thinking. This complements your plan by providing an ultra-brief, reusable action before snacking or logging.",
    "user_utterance": "I like the coping-cue idea and I’ll start with the 4-4-4 breathing as my go-to cue (60 seconds) at the first sign of craving or before a binge. If that doesn’t help, I’ll try the 30-second full-body stretch. I’ll keep the ready-to-use snacks handy (yogurt with berries or almonds with a small apple) and log within 2 minutes after snacking, or note what I ate and how it felt if I’m not ready to log. I’ll stay hydrated and focus on micro-commitments instead of perfection. If I slip, I’ll reset and use the cue again."
