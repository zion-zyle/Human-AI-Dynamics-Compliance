  "basis": "The user repeatedly articulates concrete, workable plans and expresses hope and intent to implement. However, prior interactions show a pattern of strong planning and acknowledgement of potential barriers without consistent, verifiable follow-through. This suggests a moderate likelihood of action rather than full commitment.",
  "coaching_notes": "Keep leveraging small, portable prompts (Pause and Log) and flexible reminders. Emphasize micro-actions and quick post-check-in reflections to boost accountability. Consider integrating reminders into existing routines (breakfast or calendar alerts) and provide ultra-simple logging options to reduce cognitive load on chaotic days. Encourage tracking even if only a subset of days to build momentum without triggering guilt."
