I know shifts, stress, and sleep can throw me off, but I’m committed to trying. If I feel a binge coming on, I’ll pause, take a few slow breaths, and reach for my planned snack instead.

If I’m stressed or sleep-deprived, I want the reminders to adapt rather than nag. For the checklist, keep it simple with four steps: 1) Eat the planned meals and snack within the target windows, 2) Pause and take 3–5 slow breaths when an urge arises, 3) If a snack is needed, choose from the approved list, 4) Do a quick nightly reflection: what helped today, what challenged me, and one thing I’ll adjust tomorrow."
