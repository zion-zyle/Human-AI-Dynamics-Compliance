    "agent_utterance": "Today’s quick, low-effort plan: hydrate first and keep a small, pre-planned snack ready if needed. 1) drink 250–300 ml of cold water now. 2) pause for 60 seconds and rate your urge on a 0–10 scale. 3) if urge is 4 or higher or you’re truly hungry, have a small portion (e.g., a small yogurt cup or an apple with a teaspoon of peanut butter) and log the exact amount right away. If not hungry after the pause, log a quick mood/urge note and continue sipping water. This keeps things simple, supports urges management, and fits your Wed–Fri testing window.",
    "agent_monologue": "Considering it's a hot Wednesday morning in Suwon and the user has BED with moderate sensitivity, I opted for a lightweight, hydration-first action that’s quick to log. The goal is to reduce urge intensity without adding friction, while aligning with their flexible plan to test Wed–Fri.",
    "user_utterance": "Appreciate the simple plan. It feels doable, and I like the 60-second pause to check urges. I’ll try to follow it today: sip water, rate the urge, and if it’s 4+ or I’m genuinely hungry, I’ll have a small, balanced snack (like yogurt with berries or an apple with a bit of peanut butter) and log the exact amount. If I’m not hungry, I’ll log a quick mood/urge note and keep hydrating. My one worry is I often forget to log after meals—could we add a quick reminder (like a 5-minute prompt) or an easy log shortcut? Also, on stressful days I’d appreciate a couple of extra coping prompts I can rely on. I’ll start today and track how it goes with my irregular eating pattern."

    "turn": 2,
    "agent_utterance": "Love the plan. To reduce logging friction and support you on busy or stressful days, try this: 1) set a 5-minute post-meal reminder to log your meal, urge rating, and exact amount of any snack; 2) create a one-tap log shortcut for your common options (e.g., 'Yogurt + berries' or 'Apple + peanut butter') so you can log in one tap; 3) add a couple of quick coping prompts for stress days: - 2-minute breathing (box or 4-7-8) to calm urges; - 60-second grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste); - a 2-minute walk or gentle stretch; - if urge feels high, pause for 60 seconds and ask, 'Would a small protein snack help right now?' If yes, choose the smallest appropriate portion and log it. Also, given the 32°C heat, keep water accessible and consider a light electrolyte option. Start today and tweak the timings to fit your routine.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: the hot weather in Suwon increases hydration needs and may influence urges; adding reminders reduces forgetting, and a quick log shortcut lowers friction. On stressful days, having ready coping prompts helps maintain momentum without extra effort.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable and I like the 60-second urge check. The reminders and one-tap logs could really help me stay on track, especially on busy or stressful days. A couple quick tweaks before I start: 1) make the 5-minute post-meal reminder flexible—fire after the last bite or 5 minutes after I stop eating; 2) add customizable one-tap log options (e.g., 'Yogurt + berries', 'Apple + PB', 'No snack today'); 3) coping prompts: start with two (breathing and grounding) and maybe a short walk if I’m indoors; make prompts optional or only trigger when I rate urges high. I’ll start today and monitor how logging goes with my irregular eating, tweaking timings as I learn. Hydration tip is useful too—I'll keep electrolyte in hot weather mind. Ready to go and adjust as I learn."

If you’d like, I can configure it to prompt only when urge is 4+ or after larger meals to reduce logging burden.",
    "agent_monologue": "Context: warm Suwon morning with a BED management plan in a testing window.

Treat it as optional or toggleable, and consider triggering it only when urge is 4+ to minimize friction while enriching data.",
    "user_utterance": "That works for me. I'll keep the post-meal mood/urge reflection to a single, optional line and use the trigger only when urges reach 4+ or after larger meals.
