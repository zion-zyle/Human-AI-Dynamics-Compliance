Have it within reach for your mid-morning break. After that break, spend 2 minutes logging a quick entry: your mood, your urge level (0–10), and any immediate trigger. If urges rise, use the snack or a quick 2-minute walk to reset. This small, concrete step helps you stay hydrated and grounded with minimal effort.",

I’m proposing a simple, prepped snack plus a brief post-break check-in to reduce cognitive load and support consistency.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan makes sense to me. I’ll prep a quick grab-and-go snack and water for my mid-morning break, and I’ll try the 2-minute walk if urges come up.

One quick question: when I’m away from my usual space, do you have a portable snack suggestion and a simple alternative for grounding (in case I can’t do a box breath)?

If urges pop up away from your usual space, do a quick reset: a 1–2 minute walk or a 60‑second box breath, followed by a 30‑second grounding check-in before you log your mood, urge level, and triggers after the break. Portable snack ideas: a small handful of almonds or walnuts (about 1 oz), a single-serve trail mix pack, a cheese stick, a banana or apple, or a yogurt cup if you have refrigeration. For grounding when you can’t do box breath, try 4‑7‑8 breathing or the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 senses (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste). If cravings rise around mid‑morning, it’s okay to add a light mid‑morning snack (e.g., 1 small fruit plus a small handful of nuts or a plain yogurt) as long as portions stay reasonable and you continue logging.
