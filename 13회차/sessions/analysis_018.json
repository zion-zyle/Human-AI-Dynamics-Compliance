  "basis": "The user has repeatedly expressed concrete, scalable steps (printable templates, meal-based reminders, weekly Sunday check-ins) and explicitly commits to low-stakes practice. Past interactions show strong planning and engagement, but BED can introduce day-to-day variability, so adherence is high but not guaranteed.",
  "coaching_notes": "Keep reminders lightweight and tied to meals. Frame misses as data, not failure, and encourage a quick re-entry after the next meal. Consider offering an even simpler printable template if overwhelm arises. Suggest a brief mid-week check-in as a backup to the weekly review. Reinforce micro-acknowledgments to sustain motivation."
