Pack them in your small cooler bag with an ice pack if possible, and pair with water to stay hydrated.\n\n2) Quick reset plan for chaotic days (to maintain momentum or start fresh the next day)\n- End-of-day micro-reset (5–10 minutes): write down today’s top 1–2 triggers, confirm 2 anchors you want to carry into tomorrow (e.g., wake-up protein, mid-morning protein), and prep 1 grab-and-go item for the morning.\n- Set 2 reminders for tomorrow: one for your wake-up protein anchor and one for a mid-day anchor.\n- Pre-log or plan meals for the next day in advance if you can; keep a one-tap or voice log ready.\n- If the day flips again, perform a 3-step micro reset the next morning: 3 minutes of urge-surf + 2 minutes to map 2–3 priority actions, then execute 1 concrete task.\n\n3) Hydration cue\n- Set a timer to drink a glass of water every 60 minutes (or consume 250 ml on each hour). In hot weather, target roughly 2–3 liters per day, adjusting for activity and body size. Use a marked water bottle and keep it handy during meals and transitions.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor the anchors to your typical schedule (e.g., school/work shifts, commute times) and suggest 2–3 exact grab-and-go combos for your usual days.",
