If you’re not hungry, just log water and a brief mood note, then get back to your next meal. You can set a phone reminder to cue this routine daily.",
    "agent_monologue": "Summary: It's a hot Wednesday morning in Suwon with BED and moderate stress sensitivity. To minimize friction and support adherence, I chose a tiny, concrete action that can be completed quickly and logged right away. The weather and early time suggest hydration and a simple, predictable cue to start the day. This keeps the plan low-effort (fallback baseline) while still providing structure and a clear logging moment.",
    "user_utterance": "That 2-minute routine sounds doable. I’ll start today with water and three slow breaths. If I feel hungry, I’ll try a small balanced snack like yogurt with fruit or a banana with peanut butter and log what I ate and how I feel right after. If I’m not hungry, I’ll log water and a quick mood note and then get back to my next meal. I’d also like a quick coping option for urges—like a 5-minute walk or a breathing check before grabbing food. Can we tailor snack ideas to what I actually have at home and my daily routine? I’m moderately compliant, so small, steady steps help."

Here’s a tiny, tailored setup for today that fits what you might have at home and your morning routine:\n\nUrge coping (5 minutes): choose one\n- A brisk 5-minute walk (indoors or around the block) to reset urges\n- Or box breathing: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4 for 4 cycles\nThen re-check hunger before eating.\n\nSnack ideas you can tailor to your actual stock (pick one that matches today):\n1) Yogurt + fruit: about 1/2 cup yogurt with sliced fruit and a small handful of nuts if available\n2) Banana + peanut butter: 1 banana with 1 tablespoon peanut butter\n3) Egg + veggie: 1 hard-boiled egg with cucumber or carrot sticks\n4) Cheese + crackers: 1–2 slices cheese with 4–6 whole-grain crackers and fruit if you like\n5) Tuna or canned fish on crackers: 1–2 crackers with tuna and cucumber slices\n6) Nuts + fruit: a small handful of mixed nuts with an apple or banana\n7) Oats mini-portion: 2–3 tablespoons oats mixed with a bit of yogurt or milk and fruit\n8) Rice cake topping: rice cake with a thin spread of peanut butter or tuna\n\nHow to use these: pick one snack today that fits what you have. Aim for roughly 150–250 kcal. If you’re not hungry, log water and a quick mood note and wait for your next meal.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me what you typically have at home this week (pantry/fridge items) and your usual meal times, and I’ll tailor a 3-day rotating snack plan just for you.",

Today I’ll try the urge-buster and then assess hunger. A rough typical day for me is breakfast around 8–9, lunch around 12–1, dinner around 6–7, with irregular days or occasional skipped meals. I’m aware stress can trigger binges, so I want to build a routine with gentle steps rather than all‑or‑nothing. A simple post‑meal feeling log would help a lot—maybe a quick prompt after each meal.
