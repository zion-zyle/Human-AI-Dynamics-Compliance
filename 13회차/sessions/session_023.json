    "agent_utterance": "Today in Suwon’s heat, start with these simple steps to build steady momentum: 1) Drink 350–500 ml of water now (break it into a couple of sips if needed). 2) Have a light, easy-to-digest breakfast, such as yogurt with fruit or a banana with a small glass of milk. 3) Take a 5-minute walk in a shaded or cool indoor area. 4) Do a 2-minute quick check-in: note your current urge level and mood with one sentence. Tie these actions to a regular routine (habit stacking) and adjust if the heat feels overwhelming. I’ll check back in after this window and can adjust prompts for morning or late afternoon if needed.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: today’s context includes hot weather in Suwon (32°C) and BED with moderate emotional sensitivity. I’m choosing low-friction, momentum-building micro-actions that fit into your routine and don’t add stress, aiming for a moderate execution effort (around 4/5).",
    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable and feels like a gentle, manageable start given my BED. I’ll begin with 350–500 ml of water—splitting to about 250 ml now and another portion later if needed. For breakfast, I’ll aim for something light like yogurt with fruit or a banana with a small glass of milk. I can fit a 5-minute walk in a shaded area, maybe around the building. I’ll do the 2-minute check-in and sum up my urge level and mood in one sentence. I like the habit-stacking idea and will try to weave these into my daily routine. If the heat is tough, can we shift to morning or late afternoon windows? And if urges spike, could we add a quick coping step I can do right away? I’ll report back on how it goes and what I want to tweak."

    "agent_utterance": "Here’s a practical, adaptable prompt: You’ve got this. If the heat feels heavy today, consider moving the routine to a cooler window—morning (around 7:00–9:00 AM) or late afternoon (around 5:30–7:00 PM)—and keep hydration steady (start with about 250 ml now, with another 100–150 ml later if needed). Your plan stays: 250 ml today plus a second portion later, light breakfast (yogurt with fruit or banana with a small glass of milk), a 5-minute shaded walk, and a 2-minute check-in to sum urge level and mood. If urges spike, try a quick coping step right away: 2 minutes of urge surfing with slow 4-4-4 breaths, plus a brief distraction (step outside for a moment, sip cold water, or hold an ice cube and notice the sensation). Log each action as you complete it to reinforce habit-stacking. Tell me what timing works best for you and I’ll tailor prompts accordingly.",

I’ll start with 250 ml of water now and have a second portion later if needed, keep the light breakfast like yogurt with fruit or a banana with a small glass of milk, do a 5-minute walk in shade, and do the 2-minute check-in to sum my urge level and mood in one sentence. For coping if urges spike, I’ll try the 4-4-4 urge surfing breathing plus a quick distraction—perhaps stepping outside for a moment or sipping cold water, maybe holding an ice cube to ground myself. I’ll log each action to reinforce habit-stacking. If you could keep prompts simple and check in on how I’m coping with cravings, and perhaps offer a lighter check-in when cravings spike, I’d appreciate that. I’ll report back on how it goes and what I want to tweak."
