    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the simple plan. I’m glad I have a clear starting point, but I’m also feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the steps. I can see the value in pre-portioning tomorrow's snacks and setting a quick wind-down check-in, so I’d like to try that, starting with one concrete task tonight: pack a single snack and a glass of water for tomorrow. If I can do that, we can add another step tomorrow. For BED-specific support, could we include a couple of quick coping options for cravings (like a minute of mindful breathing, a short walk, or a non-food distraction) and a simple structure for meals to help with regularity? Also, could we set a simple reminder before bed to log my snack and rate my hunger on a 1-5 scale?"

Put them where you’ll see them first thing (for example on the kitchen counter or by your bed). Example snack: yogurt cup with berries and about 500 ml of water. Keep it simple.\n- Quick coping options for cravings (choose one when cravings hit):\n  1) 60-second mindful breathing: inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6, repeat 4–6 times;\n  2) Take a short 5-minute walk or light stretch;\n  3) Non-food distraction: drink a glass of water, wash your hands/face, or text a friend.\n- Simple structure for meals to support regularity:\n  • Have three meals at roughly the same times each day plus 1–2 planned snacks.\n  • Each meal includes a protein source, fiber, and healthy fats; aim for color and balanced portions.\n  • In hot weather, include hydrating foods (cucumber, watermelon) and keep a water bottle handy.\n- Bedtime reminder plan:\n  • Set a reminder for 15–30 minutes before your usual bedtime to log your snack and rate hunger on a 1–5 scale.\n  • Use a quick log template: Snack packed? yes/no; Hunger (1–5); Notes.\n\nIf you want to add more steps tomorrow, we can build on this.

    "user_utterance": "I appreciate the simple plan. Tonight I tackled the one concrete task and packed a single snack plus a glass of water for tomorrow, left where I’ll see it first thing. I kept it easy: yogurt with berries and about 500 ml water. When cravings hit, I tried a 60-second mindful breathing and then went for a short 5-minute walk—the walk helped settle things. I’m on board with the regular-meals structure: three meals at roughly the same times plus 1–2 planned snacks, each meal with protein, fiber, and healthy fats, plus hydrating foods in this heat. I’ll set the bedtime reminder to log my snack and rate hunger on a 1–5 scale 20–30 minutes before bed.
