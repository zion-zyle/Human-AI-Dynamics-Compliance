  "coaching_notes": "UsePrompt strategies: set micro-goals, brief daily check-ins, and lightweight reminders (e.g., 1-tap logs, automated post-meal reflections). Build accountability (e.g., brief progress share or buddy check-ins) and schedule logging into existing routines to reduce cognitive load. If heavy logging feels burdensome, further reduce prompts and rely on the No Snack Today option and a single-line reflection to maintain sustainability."
