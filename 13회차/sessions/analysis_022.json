  "basis": "The user provides a concrete, feasible plan (water 400–500 ml, light breakfast, 5–7 minute walk, micro-action restart, 2-minute check-in) and expresses self-kindness. However, prior data suggests verbal commitments have not consistently translated into action, so a moderate action likelihood is prudent.",
  "coaching_notes": "To improve follow-through, couple reminders with concrete logging (e.g., a quick checkmark after each action), reduce friction by tying actions to existing routines (habit stacking), and set small, time-bound micro-actions (e.g., 1-minute hydration check-in). Consider morning and late-afternoon prompts, and explore barriers honestly in a non-judgmental way to tailor support. Maintain flexibility for heat adjustments and reinforce self-compassion."
