    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: hot weather (32°C) on a Wednesday afternoon increases dehydration risk, and the user with anorexia nervosa benefits from ultra-small, optional actions. A micro-action focused on a tiny water sip aligns with prior analysis that emphasizes autonomy, safety, and short check-ins.",
    "user_utterance": "That tiny-sip approach feels a bit like a test right now, and I get resistant when things feel scheduled. I might try a 5 ml sip if I’m calm about it, but I can’t promise a routine. Could we keep it optional, maybe tied to a meal or when I feel ready, and let me choose the drink and amount myself? If I start feeling pushed by others or the setting, please pause and we can revisit."

Afterward, pause and check how you feel. If you sense pressure from others or the setting, we pause and revisit. If you want, tell me which meal to connect to first (e.g., tonight’s dinner) and what drink you’d prefer, and I’ll help keep it flexible and non-pressuring.
