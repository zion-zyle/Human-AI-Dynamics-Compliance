I’d like to try something tiny and non-threatening tonight—maybe a few sips of water or a tiny bite of something I actually enjoy, not forced. I can’t commit to a full meal yet, but can we aim for that micro-step and see how I feel afterward?"

Option B: have 1 tiny bite of something you genuinely enjoy (for example, a grape, a strawberry, a small piece of yogurt, or a sliver of chocolate), and observe how you feel over the next 10 minutes. No pressure to do more. You can stop at any moment. If you’d like, you can check back in after a bit and reflect on your mood and bodily signals.",

    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the micro-step idea. I’m feeling wary about eating tonight, especially with others around.
