Then set a 10-minute timer and do a quick check-in on your body: notice hunger, fullness, energy, and mood. After the timer, decide if you want another tiny sip or to pause for now, at your own pace. I’m with you and you can tailor this to how you feel in the moment.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal reasoning, but here's a brief, high-level summary: given the hot weather in Suwon and the user’s preference for ultra-tiny, autonomous steps, I’m choosing a simple hydration micro-action plus a short self-check-in to minimize overwhelm and support safety.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the tiny step idea. I’m often irregular with eating and I’m wary of turning small actions into chores. 2–3 sips of water might be doable if it doesn’t feel like another obligation, and I can pause if I feel full or anxious. I’ll try the 10-minute check-in, but I might skip it if anxiety is high. If I try it, I’d prefer it to be voluntary and adjustable—maybe just a sip when I’m ready, not forced by a timer. I appreciate that you’re here with me."

If you’d like, you can sip again later, but only if you feel up to it—no timer and no obligation. If anxiety is high, you can skip the check-in entirely. If you decide to do a quick check-in, name any signals you notice (hunger, fullness, energy, mood) and use that to decide whether to sip again or pause. With the warm late-afternoon in Suwon, staying hydrated can help, but you’re in the driver’s seat. I’m here with you.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: the user prefers voluntary, adjustable micro-actions and may experience anxiety.
