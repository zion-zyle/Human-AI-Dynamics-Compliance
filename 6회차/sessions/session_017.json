Only do it if it feels easy. You can keep water by you and sip when it crosses your mind. If you prefer, a warm herbal tea or a light electrolyte drink works too. No deadline—just gentle self-care when you remember.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: it’s hot and late in the day, which can sap energy and increase resistance. A tiny, optional hydration micro-goal respects autonomy and reduces pressure while supporting self-care.",
    "user_utterance": "I hear you about the small sips of water, but drinking even a little today feels overwhelming right now. I’m feeling pretty resistant and anxious about anything to eat or drink. Could we pause on hydration for today and talk about something gentler—like a tiny routine I can manage or a snack that doesn’t feel like a big deal? I might be willing to try again later if it’s framed very softly and optional."
