    "user_utterance": "That suggestion feels heavy today, and I’m not sure I can commit to a change. My eating is already irregular and I get overwhelmed by plans or rules. If we move forward, can we keep it ultra-small and voluntary—no pressure, no deadlines? Maybe today I’d opt for a tiny snack or a warm drink only if I genuinely want it; otherwise we pause. Could we agree on one tiny step that I choose on my own and check in about it later? I want to work with you, but it has to be slow and safe."
