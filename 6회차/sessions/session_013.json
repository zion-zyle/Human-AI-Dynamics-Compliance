After the breath, decide if you want a few sips of water right now, or, if it feels safe, a tiny bite. No pressure—if you’re not ready, that’s fine. You can choose to skip today and just stay hydrated in this heat. If you do eat or drink, keep it ultra-small and stop if anything feels off.",
    "agent_monologue": "Context: hot Suwon afternoon (32°C), Wednesday, user with high emotional sensitivity. To honor autonomy and safety, I’m proposing a tiny, voluntary step rather than any prescriptive plan.

I might try a tiny sip of water now, just to start, and I’ll stop if I feel uncomfortable. If I do eat later, it has to be ultra-small and completely optional. For today, I’d rather focus on staying hydrated and keeping things simple, and we can revisit food when I’m feeling a bit safer."
