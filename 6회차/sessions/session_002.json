I won't promise more today, but if a small sip helps, I'll do that. If after 10–15 minutes I'm still not thirsty, I won't push it. If I am thirsty, maybe a super small amount of broth or diluted juice, but only if I feel up to it and nothing is forced. Let's keep it ultra-light, flexible, and based on how I feel in the moment."
