A tiny, ultra-low-pressure cue—like a 1–2 minute box breathing exercise—fits your pace and helps calm the nervous system without adding pressure. This aligns with the preference for small, doable actions.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the quick breathing tip. I’m glad you suggested something easy, but I’m pretty skeptical today. My eating is very irregular lately, and a strict routine feels like too much pressure. I can try a 1-minute box breath, or even just one slow breath before deciding to eat or drink something small. If we keep it ultra-tiny and non-pressuring, maybe with a sip of water and a single breath, I might be able to do it. Could we focus on tiny steps and a flexible plan, and maybe check in after a meal?"
