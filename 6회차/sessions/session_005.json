Sit for 2 minutes, take two slow breaths, and eat or sip just a small amount you can tolerate (for example a few almonds, a bite-sized fruit, or a tiny yogurt). This is completely optional and tied to your break moment—no pressure, just a tiny win today. If you’d rather skip it, that’s totally fine too.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private step-by-step reasoning. Brief summary: the weather is hot and it's a Wednesday afternoon in Suwon; the user has anorexia and benefits from tiny, optional nudges that feel autonomous. A low-effort cue linked to a routine moment is appropriate, focusing on a small, tolerable snack and hydration rather than rules or pressure.",
    "user_utterance": "I hear the idea of a tiny snack and a couple of slow breaths, and I appreciate it, but I’m really wary. My eating is irregular and I often feel resistance to any new routine, especially around food. If I try something, it has to be truly optional and not another rule. Could we start with something ultra-small that I can choose on a break—like one almond, or a few sips of water—only if I’m feeling up to it, and skip it if I’m not? I’d also like to keep it as a one-time experiment for today, rather than an ongoing requirement, and we can revisit how it felt later."
