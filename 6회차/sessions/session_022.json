Eat it slowly, pause anytime, and you can skip it if you’re not interested. It’s a small, optional step to support gentle self-care on a warm afternoon.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: it’s a hot Wednesday afternoon in Suwon, and the user values autonomy with low-pressure options. A tiny, cooling yogurt snack fits as an easy, voluntary self-care step that’s unlikely to trigger distress and can be paused anytime.",
    "user_utterance": "I hear you. Today the heat and my irregular eating pattern make the yogurt idea feel hard to handle. 60–90 grams sounds like a lot for me to try right now. Can we skip it today or try something even smaller that I can stop anytime? I need to feel in control and not pushed to eat."

    "agent_utterance": "Would you like to skip the yogurt today, or try something ultra-tiny and fully optional that you can stop at any moment? Here are two quick, no-pressure options: \n\nOption A (food-related, only if it feels truly optional): one tiny bite of fruit—like a single berry or grape. You can stop after that, no obligation to eat more.\n\nOption B (non-food self-care): a 60-second break in the shade with slow breathing, then a small sip of water, or a quick 1-minute grounding check-in (notice three things you feel, three sounds you hear).\n\nIf you’d prefer, you can also choose to have no step today and just rest. Which option feels safest for you right now?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here’s a brief rationale: it’s hot and eating patterns are irregular, so the user needs maximum autonomy and a non-pressuring option. Offer ultra-tiny, voluntary choices or the option to skip entirely, with a lightweight self-care alternative if desired.",
    "user_utterance": "I hear you, and I know today is tough with the heat and my irregular eating. I don’t want to be pushed to eat, so I’d like to opt out of both food-related options right now. I want to stay in control and focus on low-pressure self-care instead—finding shade, slow breathing, and a small sip of water if I feel like it, not a meal or snack. If I feel able to try something later, I’ll tell you, but for today I’d prefer no food prompts."

Here’s a tiny, optional self-care routine you can try when you’re ready: 1) Find shade and pause for 60 seconds. 2) Do a slow breathing cycle: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale for 6, repeat 3 times. 3) If you feel thirsty or want to, take a small sip of water. You can stop at any moment. I’m here to support you and will respect your pace.",
