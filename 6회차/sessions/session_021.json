In a calm setting with a trusted person, try this micro-step: place a single ultra-tiny spoonful (about 1/8 teaspoon) of a familiar, tolerated food—such as yogurt, applesauce, or a small sip of smoothie—on your tongue and hold it for 10–15 seconds, then swallow slowly. Afterward, take a few slow breaths and check in with how your body feels. If you’re comfortable, you can repeat the same micro-step later; if not, that’s perfectly okay—this remains a tiny step you can revisit when you’re ready. Want me to help pick a safe food and set a gentle reminder?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: due to the hot afternoon and potential fatigue, the user may feel more overwhelmed around eating. A micro-step in a calm setting with a trusted person minimizes anxiety and builds confidence. This aligns with prior intent to take an ultra-tiny spoonful and keeps the action extremely small.",
    "user_utterance": "That tiny step is scary, but I can see how having support might help. I’m willing to try the 1/8 teaspoon of yogurt on my tongue for 10–15 seconds if my partner is with me in a calm space and I pick a familiar food. I don’t want to feel pressured to finish, and I want the option to stop anytime. Could we schedule this for tomorrow morning with a quiet kitchen and a gentle reminder from you? If I’m not ready, that’s okay—we can adjust to something even smaller or skip for now."

Here’s a flexible setup you can use tomorrow morning. Remember, this is a choice, not a rule—if you’re not ready, you can skip or try a smaller step.\n\nTiny step (non-pressuring):\n- With your partner in a calm space, place about 1/8 teaspoon of yogurt on your tongue and hold for 10–15 seconds, then swallow slowly.\n- You may stop at any moment. Afterward, take 3–5 slow breaths and notice how your body feels.\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed at any point, switch to a smaller option (tiny taste) or just a breath and reassess later.\n\nPause signal with your partner:\n- Agree on a simple cue in advance (examples below).\n- When the cue is given, both pause, breathe together for a few moments, and check in about whether to continue.\n- Examples:\n  - Visual cue: partner raises an open palm for 2 seconds.\n  - Verbal cue: partner says a calm word like “pause” or “time-out.”\n  - Physical cue: a light touch on the forearm as a signal to stop.\n\nOptional reminder:\n- If you feel ready, you can use a reminder at 9:00 am. If not ready, skip it.\n- Copy-and-use reminder text (you can tweak it):\n  \"Reminder: Tomorrow at 9:00 am in the quiet kitchen with my partner, I will try a tiny step of yogurt (1/8 teaspoon) on my tongue, hold for 10–15 seconds, then swallow slowly. I will take a few slow breaths and check in with how my body feels. I may stop at any time or switch to a smaller step if needed.\" \n\nAlternative if not ready:\n- Do an ultra-tiny taste, or simply take a slow, grounding breath, or revisit later.\n\nImportant reminder:\n- This plan is about small, voluntary steps and safety. If you experience significant distress or symptoms, consider pausing and reaching out to a clinician or trusted professional for support.\n\nWould you like me to tailor the reminder text with your preferred wording or schedule?",
