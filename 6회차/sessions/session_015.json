If you want a tiny, low-pressure start, try one of these micro-choices with your next bite: 1) take one small bite of something you tolerate, or 2) have a single sip of water or broth. No obligation to do more—just check how you feel after. If you’d like, I can suggest a couple of familiar, gentle options you know you can handle today. You’re in control here.",
    "agent_monologue": "High-level reasoning: It's a hot Wednesday afternoon in Suwon with clear skies (32°C). The user has anorexia nervosa and is emotionally sensitive to environment and social pressure. To respect autonomy and reduce anxiety, I choose a micro, non-pressuring suggestion tied to the next bite or sip, rather than a fixed plan or schedule. The environmental heat and potential discomfort push me toward something ultra-simple and optional (one bite or one sip) that the user can opt into or skip.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the low-pressure idea. I’m glad you’re suggesting something small, but I’m not able to commit to any change today. My appetite is all over the place, and even tiny food steps can feel like a lot right now. If I do try something, it would have to be a single, familiar sip of water or broth—and only if I feel able in the moment. If not, I’d rather pause and revisit later so I don’t feel pushed. I also notice I’m more swayed by the circumstances around me, so I might need options that I can choose privately and at my own pace."
