    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: it’s a hot Wednesday afternoon in Suwon (32°C), and the user values autonomy with minimal, optional guidance. A tiny, non-pressure action fits their preference for ultra-small steps and can help with hydration and momentary grounding without triggering eating-disorder concerns. This aligns with the planned moderate suggestion while respecting autonomy and avoiding timers or mandatory check-ins.",
    "user_utterance": "I hear your suggestion to eat more today, and I want to be honest: right now the idea of a bigger meal feels overwhelming. My appetite is irregular and I tend to resist changes. If we can keep it tiny and safe, could we try a single bite of something soft or a tiny sip of a shake—just enough to test how I feel? I’d like to do it in a calm, supportive setting, maybe with someone nearby. Let’s check in in 15 minutes to decide whether to continue. Small steps still count, even when progress is slow."

In a calm setting with someone nearby for support, you could choose one ultra-tiny option: \n- A single bite of something soft (such as a spoonful of yogurt, applesauce, mashed banana, or smooth pudding), or\n- A tiny sip of a shake or milk—just enough to test how you feel.\nThere’s no timer or obligation. If you’re up for it, we’ll check in in 15 minutes to decide whether to continue. You’re in control, and every small step counts.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: the user prefers ultra-tiny, autonomy-supportive steps in a calm setting; hot weather and appetite variability make a soft, quick, low-effort test action appealing; we’ll avoid timers and keep the option open for a 15-minute check-in. This aligns with safety, support, and the user’s chosen pace.",
