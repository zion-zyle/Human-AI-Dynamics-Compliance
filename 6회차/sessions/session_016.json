If you want a tiny, private step in the next few minutes, try one of these ultra-low-pressure options: 1) Hydration: sip about 60–100 ml of cool water or a small, non-sticky drink. 2) Quick check-in: spend 2 minutes noticing your hunger or fullness and how you’re feeling, with no expectations. 3) If it feels completely voluntary, a single, tiny bite you tolerate (for example, a small grape or a half rice cracker)—only if it doesn't feel like pressure. No obligation to act now; you can pause and revisit when you’re ready.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: it’s a hot late-afternoon in Suwon (32°C), which can affect mood and appetite. I’m choosing a ultra-low-pressure, private micro-action that respects your pace and autonomy.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the gentle options. It’s really hot and I’m feeling resistant today. I think I can try the hydration piece: maybe a small sip of water in a few minutes if I remember. I’m not sure about the two-minute check-in yet, but I’ll try to notice how hungry or full I feel without judging it. The tiny bite worries me—safe to skip for now.

    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: it’s hot (32°C) and you’ve expressed resistance, so a tiny, private hydration nudge is a low-effort option that respects your pace.
