You can skip any step and just rest. If you feel up to it later, you might have a small snack you feel comfortable with.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here's a brief rationale: hot weather and late afternoon can sap energy and trigger a pull toward rest. Because you prefer optional prompts, the best fit is a tiny, non-pressuring micro-action that supports hydration and a short pause without adding pressure.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for checking in. I hear your latest suggestion, but given my anorexia and how irregular my eating is, I feel really resistant and easily influenced by what's going on around me. A concrete plan feels overwhelming right now. Could we keep it ultra-low-pressure and optional? Maybe one tiny step today—like naming whether I’m hungry, sipping a small amount of water, or trying a familiar snack for a few minutes with no expectation to eat more. If possible, I’d like to do this with support from my therapist or a trusted person. I’ll let you know how I’m feeling after trying something small, and we can adjust from there. For now, I’d prefer to stay flexible and not commit to a specific eating goal."

You can choose one tiny micro-step and nothing else, with support from your therapist or a trusted person if you’d like. Options: 1) Name your current hunger: hungry / not hungry / unsure. 2) If you want a small hydrating check, take one tiny sip of water and pause for 1–2 minutes. 3) If you prefer a snack, hold a familiar item in your hand for 3–5 minutes with no expectation to eat more. If you’d like, I can help you draft a brief note to your therapist or trusted person to join you in this small step. Tell me which option you want to try, or say you’d rather skip for now, and I’ll check back later and we’ll adjust together.",

I’d also like to ask you to help me draft a short note to my therapist or a trusted person so they can join me in this small step and we can check in after.
