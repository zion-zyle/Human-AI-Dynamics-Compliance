If 4 bites feel too much, start with 2 and adjust. The goal is gentle nourishment without pressure in this hot afternoon in Suwon.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief justification: given the hot afternoon in Suwon (32°C) and the user's anorexia nervosa with high emotional sensitivity, a tiny, non-pressuring action is most likely to be accepted. The suggested action aligns with a small, achievable intake target (roughly 4 bites) to minimize stress while supporting nourishment.",
    "user_utterance": "Ugh, I hear you, but four bites feels overwhelming today. I might be able to manage 1 or 2 tiny bites if I’m not pressured about a goal. Right now the heat, my irregular schedule, and my mood make it hard to eat. Could we keep it ultra-flexible—maybe just a small bite or even a sip of water—and decide in the moment? If you have a couple of snack ideas that are very mild and easy to tolerate, please share, but I might not choose them right away."

If you decide you’d like something small later, here are ultra-mild options you can choose from when you’re ready: - a few sips of water or a cool drink - 1 thin slice of apple or 1 grape - 1 teaspoon plain yogurt or a tiny spoon of porridge - a few cucumber or melon slices - a single rice cracker crumb or a tiny piece of soft bread. If none feel right, that’s absolutely okay—hydration comes first, and we can check in again in a bit. Stay cool in Suwon today.",
