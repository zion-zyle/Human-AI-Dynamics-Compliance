  "basis": "The user explicitly pauses and postpones any intake today due to heat and risk, framing a future, conditional plan (one ultra-tiny sip if completely safe). This indicates low current action likelihood and a preference to delay, yielding a modest alignment with the suggestion rather than full execution today.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Balance between wanting to honor pace and a lurking interest in small steps; tension between needing safety (pause) and curiosity about trying later. High sensitivity to environment (heat) creates internal push-pull about acting now vs. delaying.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "All-or-nothing thinking about steps being risky; self-critique for not acting; fear of stress from dietary change; overemphasis on immediate safety at the expense of gradual progress.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Heat-induced fatigue, fear of stress, desire for safety, need for non-pressuring support, wanting to maintain autonomy.",

Consider scheduling a micro-check-in later or providing a clear, ultra-tiny next-step option that remains optional."
