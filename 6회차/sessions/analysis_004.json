  "coaching_notes": "Continue offering brief, optional nudges tightly linked to existing routine moments. Emphasize autonomy and feasibility, and anticipate slight skepticism by framing progress as tiny wins after a few days. Check-ins should remain brief and non-judgmental; consider reinforcing with positive acknowledgment of attempts."
