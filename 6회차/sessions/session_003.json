    "user_utterance": "I hear you, but the last suggestion feels overwhelming for me today. My eating is really irregular and I'm highly resistant to big changes. I can't commit to that level right now. Can we keep it ultra-small and optional—like a tiny bite of something I tolerate or a few sips of water, only if I feel up to it? No pressure, and we can check in later to see how I'm doing. If I feel pushed, I'll shut down. Let's aim for easing my anxiety first, then we can talk about food at my pace."
