If a binge urge pops up, I’ll pause, drink water, eat the fruit, and check back in. Being in my 30s, female, with BED, I’m moderately compliant and a bit sensitive to changes, so having the cue gives me some stability. If you have a quick craving-busting tip (like a short breathing exercise) or a way to note mood/trigger in the log, I’d love to try it."

    "agent_utterance": "Nice plan. Here are two quick tools you can try tonight:\n\n1) Quick craving-busting tip: box breathing. Breathe in through the nose for 4 counts, hold 4, breathe out through the mouth for 4, hold 4. Do 4 rounds (about 1 minute). This helps calm urges without breaking your flow.\n\n2) Tiny mood/trigger log you can use in the app: add 4 fields for a ultra-brief entry each time you log, or use the short template below.\n- Mood (0–10)\n- Trigger (choose: Emotional, Boredom, Stress, Hunger, Environment)\n- Urge (0–10)\n- Context (time/place)\n\nExample: Mood 6 | Trigger Stress | Urge 7 | 9:00 PM, home living room\n\nIf you prefer an even simpler entry, use: Mood-Trigger-Urgence: 6-Stress-7.\n\nWant me to save this as a quick-entry template in your log for easy one-tap use later?",
