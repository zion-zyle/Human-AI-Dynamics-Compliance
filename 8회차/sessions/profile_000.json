On weekdays I usually eat at roughly the same times: breakfast around 7–8 am, lunch around 12–1 pm, and dinner around 6–7 pm, with a mid‑afternoon snack around 3–4 pm. Weekends are more variable, with later breakfasts or dinners and sometimes skipping a snack. I notice that larger gaps or irregular meals tend to spike cravings and the urge to binge. I’m open to making the schedule a bit more consistent to support BED management. Today I’ll aim to keep meals within a consistent window and watch for urges, then report back on how it felt."
