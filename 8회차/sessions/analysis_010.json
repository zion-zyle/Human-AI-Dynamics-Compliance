  "basis": "The user consistently verbalizes ultra-simple plans and check-ins, but past behavior suggests variable follow-through. The current plan is feasible, but social dinners and late nights introduce risk, making a conservative action estimate appropriate.",
  "coaching_notes": "Suggestions: 1) lock in a concrete, short check-in time and set automatic reminders; 2) pre-plan for social dinners (pre-set finish times and a fixed check-in window); 3) identify top triggers and keep the wind-down strictly 1â€“2 minutes; 4) establish an accountability buddy or app-based prompt; 5) review what helped after each attempt and adjust the plan accordingly."
