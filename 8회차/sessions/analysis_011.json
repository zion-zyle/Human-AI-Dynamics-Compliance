  "basis": "The user repeatedly outlines concrete, doable steps (wind-down timing, post-event routine, reminders, pre-selected snack) and commits to testing tonight after a Suwon outing. Past behavior shows consistent attempts to follow structured plans, with willingness to report back. While fatigue and busy nights can impede action, the explicit sequencing and accountability hooks make a high-probability action likely.",
  "coaching_notes": "Continue to reinforce micro-commitments and reliable reminders. Ensure the automation actually triggers (test the calendar reminder). Have a clear fallback plan for tech hiccups (home-screen cue, quick ping). Encourage accountability buddy checks and simple 'if-then' promises (e.g., if late, I still do breathing and grounding for 2 minutes). Track slips and successes to adjust plans gradually."
