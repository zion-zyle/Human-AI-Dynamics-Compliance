    "agent_utterance": "Two-step night plan: 1) Start with a tall glass of water (or cool herbal tea) and a brief 60-second check-in to distinguish thirst from hunger. 2) If you’re still hungry after the check-in, choose a small, satisfying option around 150 kcal (for example, 150 g plain Greek yogurt with a few berries, or a small handful of almonds) and eat slowly with 3 mindful breaths. If you’re truly not hungry after step 1, shift to hydration and a calming activity (stretching, light walk, or mobile-friendly distraction) to help wind down. This keeps it manageable tonight and supports steady progress toward smaller, consistent changes.",

    "user_utterance": "That two-step night plan sounds doable. I’ll try starting with a tall glass of water and a quick 60-second hunger/thirst check tonight.

If I’m not hungry after step 1, what non-food wind-down activities do you recommend? Also, could we add a short coping-skills list (breathing, gentle stretch, short walk) to use on tough nights?

    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the plan. I’m in for tonight: start with a tall glass of water and the quick hunger/thirst check. One concern: with BED, even a small 150 kcal snack can sometimes trigger a binge. Could we tighten snack options to strictly around 150 kcal and ensure they’re protein plus fiber? If possible, I’d like a short, tight list (maybe 4–6 options) and a labeled max of 150 kcal per option, plus a strict slow-eating rule (15–20 minutes, chew 20–30 times per bite, utensil down between bites, sip water between bites, pause every 3–4 bites to assess hunger). If I’m not hungry after Step 1, I’d prefer non-food wind-down activities only.
