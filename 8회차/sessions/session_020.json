Tonight, keep it ultra-simple: 1) drink a tall glass of cold water and wait 5 minutes. 2) if you still feel hungry, have one very small, pre-portioned snack (e.g., a small apple or a single-serving yogurt) and no second helpings. 3) log it with one-tap logging or a quick 5-second voice memo. If you can't log, just note 'snack: 0 or 1' and reset for tomorrow. Stay cool in this heat—small steps beat big all-or-nothing changes.",

I’ll try the 5-minute pause first when hunger hits, and if I’m still hungry I’ll reach for a very small, pre-portioned snack (like a small apple or a single yogurt cup) rather than grazing.
