  "basis": "The user repeats a concrete plan with explicit steps and check-ins, suggesting a mid-range likelihood of action. However, they acknowledge potential BED-related overwhelm and the need to reach out for support, which could dampen consistency, especially at night. Without clear evidence of consistently high past adherence, a cautious mid-level estimate is appropriate.",
  "coaching_notes": "Leverage micro-commitments and accountability. Suggestions: pair the plan with a quick post-snack log (e.g., 1-minute note), set a reminder for the 8:30 PM check-in, and pre-arrange a support contact for tonight if cravings spike. Consider implementing 'if-then' strategies (e.g., If craving > X, do Y within 2 minutes and log). Address BED risk factors by reinforcing sleep hygiene and providing a direct line for support when overwhelmed."
