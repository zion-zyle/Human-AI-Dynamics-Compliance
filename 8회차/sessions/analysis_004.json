  "basis": "The user continues to draft actionable, micro-level plans (water intake, box breathing, craving log, optional mood/energy tags) and acknowledges contingencies. However, past behavior tends to show variability and occasional drift from full execution, so the final commitment appears moderate rather than high certainty.",
  "coaching_notes": "Keep plans ultra-light and with a single non-negotiable action. Add a simple, consistent cue or reminder and use small, frequent check-ins to sustain momentum. Address heat-related context and ensure trackers remain minimal to reduce cognitive load. Explore barriers behind verbal agreement to improve follow-through."
