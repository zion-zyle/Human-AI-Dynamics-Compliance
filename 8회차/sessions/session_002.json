    "agent_monologue": "Contextual factors include a hot Suwon evening (32°C), BED sensitivity, and it being late. I’m choosing a brief, cooling, low-effort plan with 2 tight snack options and a quick urge-management step to minimize decision fatigue while keeping things actionable and setting up a tomorrow check-in.",
    "user_utterance": "I appreciate the plan. I think I'll go with Option 1 tonight—cold Greek yogurt with a handful of frozen berries—since it's quick and not overly sweet. I'll focus on slow chewing for 2–3 minutes and note my fullness and craving level afterward. The 5-minute urge-surging technique sounds doable: name the craving, take four deep breaths, have a glass of water, then wait. I’ll prep the snack ahead of time and set an 8:30pm check-in for tomorrow. If cravings spike, could we add a quick protein or fiber boost or a short distraction strategy?"

If cravings spike, try one of these quick boosts: 1) Quick protein boost: stir 1–2 tablespoons of peanut butter into the yogurt or eat a small handful (8–12) of almonds. 2) Quick fiber boost: add 1 tablespoon chia seeds or ground flaxseed to the yogurt, or pair with a small apple. 3) Short distraction: 3-minute light walk around your space, 2 minutes of gentle stretching, or a 5-minute breathing/grounding exercise (for example 4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 6 seconds out).
