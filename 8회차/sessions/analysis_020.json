  "basis": "The user verbally commits to the plan and reminders and frames it around BED, but prior patterns suggest a gap between intention and execution. This warrants a mid-range action expectation rather than full confidence.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain skepticism but support with ultra-simple prompts. Encourage micro-habits (e.g., one-tap logging after each prompt), implement a brief post-prompt check, and consider a lightweight accountability step (e.g., daily quick reflection). Explore barriers (cravings, schedule shifts) and reinforce non-judgmental resets to sustain gradual progress."
