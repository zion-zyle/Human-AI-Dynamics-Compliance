  "coaching_notes": "Focus on concrete, tiny commitments with immediate prompts (e.g., a fixed, short window after routine, automatic reminders). Explore barriers (fatigue, heat, BED cravings) and simplify further if needed. Use accountability prompts (daily check-in, automatic logging) and reduce friction by presetting cues and pre-loading coping moves."
