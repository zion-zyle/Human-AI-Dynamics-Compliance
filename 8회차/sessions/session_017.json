If cravings show up, add a simple non-food coping activity for 5–10 minutes (stretch, a short walk, or a calming stretch).\n\n- 24-hour micro-goal:\n  - Complete the post-meal micro-step after every meal today (typically after breakfast, lunch, and dinner). For each meal, record: fullness score (1–5), whether cravings occurred (yes/no), and one coping action used (if cravings were present).\n\n- Simple check-in plan:\n  - Set a light reminder 15 minutes after each meal to prompt the micro-step.\n  - By around 9 pm, do a quick check-in: did you complete the post-meal step for each meal? did cravings occur? what coping action did you try?\n  - If you miss a meal, jot down what got in the way and plan a tiny adjustment for tomorrow (e.g., move the reminder earlier or simplify the step).\n\n- Gentle guidance for BED and sensitivity:\n  - Focus on consistency over perfection.

Tonight I’ll start with your ultra-tiny plan: post-meal 5-minute pause, ~200 ml water, 2 minutes of gentle breathing, then log fullness (1–5) and cravings; if cravings pop up, I’ll do a 5–10 minute non-food coping activity and log that too. On social days I’ll add a very brief grounding cue if breathing feels awkward and I’ll write a one-line self-compassion note after logging. Mood tracking is optional: I’d like to add a simple mood rating (1–5) in the log—after meals or at 9 pm, whichever is easier—kept light so it doesn’t feel burdensome. The 24-hour micro-goal stays: complete after breakfast, lunch, and dinner with fullness, cravings, and one coping action logged after each meal. Reminders at 15 minutes after each meal and a quick 9 pm check-in. If I miss a meal, I’ll note what happened and tweak tomorrow. Morning reset remains the 2-minute ritual. Neutral days use the no cravings/no coping action option; travel/exhaustion backup is log fullness after one meal only. If last action score stays low for several days, we’ll simplify further (shorter pause, possibly skip breathing) and add a light reminder nudge (text) while continuing to log fullness and cravings. I’d be happy to provide a mood-augmented one-line log template—let me know whether you want mood tracked after each meal or at 9 pm. I’ll report back tonight.",
