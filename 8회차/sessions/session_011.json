    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: It's Thursday night in Suwon with hot weather, and BED risk is higher with late snacking. The plan should be ultra-simple and doable: a small, balanced snack, quick hydration, a 2-minute wind-down, and a fixed morning check-in with accountability. This aligns with the coaching notes and supports small, sustainable progress.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the plan—it's simple and doable, which helps with BED. I like the focus on a small, structured snack instead of all-or-nothing dieting. I’ll aim for about 150–180 kcal tonight, with protein and fiber, like plain yogurt with berries or a small apple with 1 tablespoon peanut butter, and pair it with water or caffeine-free tea. I’ll do the 2-minute wind-down and jot a quick note about tomorrow’s goal. For tomorrow, I’ll set 7:30 AM as a check-in time and ask a friend to ping me. If I’m still hungry after the snack, I’ll go for veggies (carrots or cucumber). If cravings spike, could we add a brief urge-surviving step or a 10-minute delay? Also, any tips for late nights out in Suwon would be great."

    "agent_utterance": "Urge-surviving step: when cravings spike, try a 10-minute pause. Set a timer, do 2 minutes of box breathing, take a quick 5-sense grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste), and sip a glass of water or non-caffeinated tea. After the 10 minutes, reassess hunger and choose an option within your 150–180 kcal target (e.g., plain yogurt with berries or a small veggie snack if still hungry). Late-night Suwon tips: - If you’re going out, eat a light pre-outing snack and stay hydrated to blunt cravings. - Prefer venues with healthier options (grilled proteins, salads, veggie sides) and limit fried or heavy items. - Limit alcohol and sugary drinks, as they can amplify cravings. - carry a small healthy snack and have a ready-to-say phrase to decline extra eating (e.g., “I’m pacing my night now, thanks”). - set a check-in with a friend (e.g., 7:30 AM) and plan a hard cutoff for late-night eating (e.g., no meals after 12:30 AM). - if you need movement after social time, a short 5–10 minute walk can help reduce urges.
