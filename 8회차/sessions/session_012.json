For higher urges (say above 7), maybe we could add a quick micro-step (a 1-minute grounding exercise or a short walk) before deciding on snacks.

    "agent_utterance": "Yes—moving your nightly BED check-in reminder earlier or later is fine as long as you stay within a reasonable window and log the change. Practical guidance: use a ±60-minute window around your intended time. If you shift within that window, treat it as the same check-in and note the new time in your log. If you find you need to shift more often or regularly outside that window, consider a rolling anchor (e.g., 'within 60 minutes of bedtime') and update your log accordingly.
