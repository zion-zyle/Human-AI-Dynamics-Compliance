If yes, note the snack and rate your craving on a 0-10 scale. If no snack, give yourself a quick ‘done’ note. 4) If cravings arise at bedtime, choose one tiny, satisfying option (e.g., one small piece of fruit or a small handful of almonds) and keep it to a single portion. 5) Tomorrow, set a simple one-line plan: 'Post-dinner log + 2-minute wind-down.'",

    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable tonight. I like the simple steps: hydrate, a quick wind-down, then log cravings. I’ll be honest about what I end up snacking and rate the urge. My concern is evening triggers—I binge more when I’m stressed. Could we add a short non-food coping option after dinner, like a 2–3 minute breathing exercise or a quick 5-minute grounding walk? If I truly crave something, I’ll choose the smallest portion as you suggested, and stop after one serving. I’ll also log what I ate and how strong the craving was, and report back on how it went tonight."
