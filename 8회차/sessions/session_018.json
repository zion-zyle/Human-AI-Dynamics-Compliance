If the urge fades, you're done. 2) If you’re still hungry after the wait, have one small, pre-portioned option (for example, 1 small fruit like a mandarin or about 8 almonds).

    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my detailed internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: it's hot and late in Suwon, which can raise urge to snack and affect mood. Given BED and moderate emotional sensitivity, a single ultra-tiny, low-friction step is most likely to stick. Mood tracking stays optional to avoid adding burden, and a simple pause-and-choose approach aligns with your preference for small, doable actions.",
    "user_utterance": "Sounds doable. I’ll try water first and wait two minutes tonight since it’s hot. If the urge still sticks, I’ll choose a small pre-portioned option like a mandarin or about 8 almonds. If the mood check-in feels like too much, I’ll skip it, but I’ll try a quick grounding or a 1–2 minute breathing break when deciding. My worry is I sometimes want more after a small snack—what should I do if the urge returns after I’ve had the snack? I want to keep this simple and nonjudgmental."

If it’s 0–3, you’re likely satisfied. If it’s 4 or higher, do a quick grounding or 1–2 minute breathing break. 2) after the break, choose one immediate tiny option: a) drink a glass of water or warm tea, b) take a short 3–5 minute walk or gentle stretch, or c) have one extra ultra-tiny portion (for example, half a mandarin or 4–6 almonds). 3) set a simple wait rule: wait 15–20 minutes before deciding again. If the craving returns after that window, repeat the same three steps. Keep it kind and nonjudgmental—this is about gentle self-care, not perfection.

I’ll start with the 1-minute hunger check after a snack, use a quick grounding if the rating is high, then pick one tiny option and wait 15–20 minutes. I worry that even a small snack can spark more urges, so I’ll rate hunger again after the break and loop through the three steps if needed. Tonight, because it’s hot and late, I’ll give myself extra grace. If this becomes frequent, we can tweak it—maybe shorter waits or different tiny options—and add a simple accountability nudge.
