    "agent_utterance": " Ultra-simple guidance in response to your two questions: \n\n1) If walking isn’t easy tonight, is brushing teeth or mouth rinse enough for a reset? Yes. It’s a valid reset, especially when you pair it with a tiny sensory/behavior change. Try this minimal sequence tonight: 1) optional 1 minute box breathing (4-4-4-4), 2) brush teeth or rinse with mouthwash, 3) sip a glass of cold water, 4) 1–2 minute wind-down (dim lights, gentle stretch or shoulder rolls), 5) log the craving and finish with your one-line craving journal. If you want even less, you can skip the breathing and wind-down, and just do steps 2–3–4. \n\n2) Should you set a specific check-in time tonight? Yes. A concrete check-in improves follow-through. Consider one of these:\n- Option A (immediate): check in 10–15 minutes after you finish the routine (e.g., if you finish around 12:15 AM, check in by 12:25 AM).\n- Option B (next morning): set a fixed morning check-in time (e.g., 8:00 AM tomorrow). Pick the option that fits your sleep and schedule, and set a reminder.\n\nIf you finish later and feel unsure, you can still text me with a quick note about what you tried and what helped. Weather and late hour can tilt urges, so keep it ultra-simple and adaptable. Let me know which check-in option you’ll use and what time you want to aim for tonight.",
