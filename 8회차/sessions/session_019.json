Try to do this within the next 5 minutes. If you’re not hungry after this, you can skip the snack and plan a light option for tomorrow.",

To fit these factors, I’m recommending a micro-commitment that’s quick, hydration-focused, and easy to recover from if you slip—keeping the action low-friction and aligned with your need for small, actionable steps.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the quick plan—this feels doable. I’ll start with water and a small fruit or yogurt, and try the 2-minute breath to check if I’m truly hungry before snacking.
