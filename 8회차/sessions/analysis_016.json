  "basis": "The user explicitly asks for a fullness-log template and commits to reporting back after meals, indicating moderate initiative. However, their history shows mixed follow-through with plans, suggesting action is likely but not guaranteed. A mid-range action value (3.2) balances intent with past variability.",
  "coaching_notes": "Provide a ready-to-use fullness-log template and offer a lightweight daily check-in workflow. Keep templates mobile-friendly and quick to complete. Encourage testing the template this meal and reporting back on what helped or didnâ€™t, so we can refine. Consider adding automated prompts or reminders to reduce friction on busy or travel days."
