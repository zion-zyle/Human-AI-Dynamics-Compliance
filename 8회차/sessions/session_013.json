    "agent_monologue": "I'm unable to share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: It's hot and late in Suwon, which can dampen motivation. A tiny, high-yield micro-step—breathing, hydration, and a quick log—fits the user’s preference for small steps and reduces friction at night. This aligns with coaching notes to automate logging and use a lightweight fallback.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the latest suggestion (3.08). It feels doable, but evenings are tricky for me with BED, so I’m taking it slow. I can commit to one small change today: a 5-minute mindful check-in when cravings hit, a protein-rich snack around 3–4 PM, and a short 10-minute walk after dinner. I’ll log whatever happens tonight and adjust tomorrow. Could we set a simple cue (like a phone reminder) to prompt the check-in, so I don’t skip it?"

    "agent_utterance": "Love the plan. Here’s a simple cue you can set up today: create one daily phone reminder at 3:50 PM titled 5-min mindful check-in. When it rings, spend five minutes: (1) do two minutes of slow breathing, (2) rate your craving 0–10, (3) note what triggered it, (4) decide on one action: have the protein-rich snack (3–4 PM window) or start the 10-minute walk after dinner (or both), and (5) log the check-in quickly in your journal. If you miss the cue, log retroactively tomorrow morning. How to set it up: on iPhone, use the Reminders app to create a daily reminder at 3:50 PM; on Android, use Google Reminders or Calendar to create a daily alert at 3:50 PM. If cravings vary, you can add a second cue around 4:45 PM. This keeps the process low-effort and aligned with your tonight plan.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: a single, predictable cue reduces skipping on BED days. A simple phone reminder right before your typical craving window keeps the check-in moment lightweight and easy to log.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels right, and I appreciate the focus on small, doable steps since evenings can be tough with BED. I’ll set a 3:50 PM reminder for the 5-minute mindful check-in, and I might add a 4:45 PM cue if cravings show up. I’ll also aim for the 3–4 PM protein snack and a 10-minute walk after dinner. I’ll log tonight and adjust tomorrow. If anything feels off, I’ll let you know and we can tweak it."

A couple quick tips to help tonight: prep the protein snack so it’s easy to grab, set a one-tap log, and keep the 60-minute retro log option handy. If cravings spike, try a brief 2-minute breathing cycle and a glass of water before deciding on the action. Hydration helps in the heat too.
