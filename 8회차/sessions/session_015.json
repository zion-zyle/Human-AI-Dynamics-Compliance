Do these three steps: 1) With one tap, log your three fields (what you ate, your hunger level, and your mood) in a small time window tonight. If you miss it, you can log later—keep it minimal. 2) Do box breathing for about a minute: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4, repeat. 3) Set a gentle reminder for logging and breathing at a consistent time tonight (e.g., 21:45–22:15) and keep a glass of water nearby. Small, doable steps add up; you’ve got this.",
    "agent_monologue": "Considering the hot Suwon weather, it’s Friday night, and the user has BED with moderate emotional sensitivity. The plan should be ultra-simple to maximize tonight's adherence: a tiny, two-minute action (one-tap log), a brief breathing exercise, and easy reminders, plus a focus on staying hydrated. This aligns with a minimal, tonight-only approach to build momentum without overwhelm.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable tonight. I can log the three fields with one tap before bed, and I’ll log later if I miss it. The 1-minute box breathing (4-4-4) sounds calming—I’ll try it when cravings hit. I’ll set a gentle reminder around 21:45–22:15 and keep a glass of water nearby. My main challenge is nighttime urges, so I’m glad these steps are short and easy. If cravings spike, I’ll pause, breathe, and maybe take a quick walk or reach out for support. I’ll let you know how it goes."
