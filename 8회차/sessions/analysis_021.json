  "basis": "The user consistently outlines a clear, minimal action plan (pause, water, log) and has previously shown willingness to follow through with micro-steps. They acknowledge optional backup strategies and plan for tweaks, which suggests strong engagement but with potential flexibility that could temper perfect adherence.",
  "coaching_notes": "Keep reinforcing the core micro-step (pause + water + logging) and minimize cognitive load. Consider adding light prompts or reminders to log immediately after the pause. If adherence droops, help the user re-anchor to the simplest version and explore practical barriers (time, mood, environment) with tiny adjustments rather than overhauling the plan."
