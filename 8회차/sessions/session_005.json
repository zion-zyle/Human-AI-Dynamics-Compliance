    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full internal reasoning, but here’s a concise rationale: BED, hot evening, and late hour increase risk of cravings and overwhelm.

    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll give two minutes of box breathing before bed a try. The 4-4-4-4 pattern sounds calm and doable, and non-food is perfect for BED. If I’m too tired, I’ll scale down to a minute and build up. I’ll track how it affects my sleep and evening cravings and report back. Any tips on making it a reliable habit would help."

    "agent_utterance": "Great plan. Here are simple steps to make 2 minutes of box breathing a reliable nightly habit (with a safe fallback to 1 minute if you’re very tired):\n- Use a clear cue: after your usual bedtime routine, start 2 minutes of box breathing. If you’re exhausted, do 1 minute instead and build back up gradually.\n- Add a tiny reminder: set a one-tap alarm or place a small sticky note on your nightstand labeled 'Box Breath' so you don’t have to rely on memory.\n- Keep the tracking ultra-light: jot a single line in your notes, e.g., 'BoxBreath: 2 min / Yes' (or 'BoxBreath: 1 min / Yes'), plus a quick sleep rating (1–5) and craving level (0–3).\n- Environment tips: keep the room as cool as comfortable (fan or window if safe). Hydration is fine; avoid caffeine late in the day.\n- Getting back on track: if you miss a night, just start again the next evening without overhauling the plan.\n- When you’ve tried it tonight, tell me: your sleep score (1–5) and your craving level (0–3), and whether you did 2 or 1 minute. I’ll tailor tips for tomorrow.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: the late hour and heat increase fatigue risk, so a tiny, cue-based habit with minimal logging tends to stick better than longer goals.

    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. I like the 4-4-4-4 pattern and the option to drop to 1 minute if I’m tired. I’ll set a simple cue right after my bedtime routine and a quick reminder.
