Keep water nearby or a warm, non-caloric beverage if you tolerate it. 2) Lighten logging when tired: use a one-line entry (Time; Trigger/Emotion; Urge 0–10; Action; Outcome) or a quick voice memo like 'Late-night trigger, bored; urge 6; drank water; paused; calmer.' Pre-fill 2–3 common triggers so you can log with one tap. Tiny aloud prompts to say during cravings: 'Pause, sip, decide.' or 'This urge will pass; I am in control.'

If you want a slightly longer breathing sequence for tougher nights, you can extend to 4 rounds of 4-4-4-4 (about 80–100 seconds) before logging. 6) Optional cue: set a recurring reminder to perform the reset at the same time each night so it becomes a habit.",
