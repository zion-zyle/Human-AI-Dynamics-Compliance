  "basis": "The user is clearly committed tonight, reiterating the plan with specific snack options, slow-eating rules, and non-food wind-down. However, their history (as described) shows a pattern of planning without guaranteed follow-through, and current factors like heat and cravings increase risk. The request for a check-in tomorrow suggests accountability, which supports mid-range likelihood of compliance rather than full certainty.",
  "coaching_notes": "To boost real-world compliance, simplify further (2â€“3 tight snack choices), add explicit reminders or prompts, and set a concrete check-in time. Reduce decision fatigue by having snacks pre-selected and ready. Build accountability with a brief post-task reflection (What went well? What was hard?). Consider environmental tweaks (cooling, water readily accessible) and urge-management techniques (urge surfacing strategies) to bridge intention and action."
