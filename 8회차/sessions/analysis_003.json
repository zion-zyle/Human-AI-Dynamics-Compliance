  "basis": "The user repeatedly expresses a calm, ultra-simple plan and intentions to implement prompts, but past behavior in similar conversations shows variable follow-through. Verbal commitment is present, but consistency remains uncertain, yielding a moderate action likelihood.",
  "coaching_notes": "Leverage micro-commitments and reminders (e.g., 11:25 PM cue, pre-snack breathing). Provide an extremely simple checklist as the user suggested, and offer quick logging prompts. Consider brief daily check-ins to surface barriers and adjust the plan to reduce cognitive load. Emphasize hydration and environmental supports to manage heat-related urges."
