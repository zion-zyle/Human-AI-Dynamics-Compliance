    "agent_utterance": "Great idea to add a built-in 10-minute delay and slightly more appealing snack options. Here's a concrete, easy-to-use plan for today: \n\n1) Slightly more appealing snack options (small portions):\n- 1 small apple with 6–8 almonds\n- 1/2 cup Greek yogurt with a few berries\n- 1 small rice cake with 1 tsp peanut butter\n- a handful (8–10) of nuts with a small square of dark chocolate\n- veggie sticks (carrot or cucumber) with 2 tbsp hummus\n\n2) When you notice an urge, start a 10-minute delay and use it for a quick coping step (2-minute walk or 4 slow breaths), plus a glass of water, and log the urge.\n\n3) After the 10 minutes, reassess: if you’re still hungry or the urge persists, choose one of the snack options above and log it. If not hungry, you can skip the snack.\n\n4) Keep the 5-minute urge check-in as your anchor and use reminders. If travel or warmth makes it harder, adjust portions and rely a bit more on the delay and coping steps.",

If I’m not hungry after 10 minutes, I’ll log and skip the snack; if I am hungry, I’ll choose one of the snack options you listed and log it. My one worry is days when I’m busy or traveling; the timing might be hard, and I might need extra flexibility. Could we add a portable non-food option during the delay (a quick stretch or a short step outside) in case I don’t want to snack? Overall, I’m committed to trying this today and will keep logging."

    "agent_utterance": "Updated practical plan for today: When an urge hits, start a 10-minute delay. During that delay, perform a coping step (2-minute walk or 4 slow breaths) plus a glass of water. Add a portable non-food option during the delay: choose one of the following (about 2–3 minutes total): quick stretch sequence (neck rolls, shoulder rolls, gentle arm and wrist stretches, ankle circles, light hamstring/calf stretch); or a short outdoor pause (step outside for 1–2 minutes, take 4 slow breaths); or seated options (seated torso twist, ankle circles). After 10 minutes, assess: if still hungry, pick one snack option from the list and log it; if not hungry, log that and skip the snack. Keep the 5-minute urge check-in as your anchor and set reminders. On travel days or busy times, apply the same flow but adjust the delay length to fit your schedule; the key is to log everything and stay flexible.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: hot, busy, or travel days increase cognitive load and reduce willpower; providing portable, non-food delay options helps you pause without added friction and supports consistent logging.",

If after 10 minutes I’m not hungry, I’ll log and skip the snack; if I am hungry, I’ll pick one snack option and log it. My worry is busy travel days, so I want to stay flexible. Could we allow the delay to be adjustable (for example 5–15 minutes) when I’m rushed, and keep the portable options quick (2–3 minutes tops)? Also, a quick cue on my phone to pause before snacking might help. I’ll keep logging and adjust as needed. Appreciate the support."
