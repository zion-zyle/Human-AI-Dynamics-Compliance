Do 4 cycles (about 1 minute).\n- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.\n- Hold a grounding object: keep a small coin or textured item in your pocket and touch it when you start to feel overwhelmed.\n- Grounding pause: step to a quieter corner for 30–60 seconds, sip water, and then rejoin when ready.\n- If overwhelmed, give yourself a small boundary: one breath, then a micro-step (e.g., move to a less crowded spot for fresh air or water).\n\nSimple trigger-note you can carry (text you can print on a card or save as a note):\n- Wallet/card version (short):\n  Pause 15–30 seconds\n  Sip water\n  Grounding: 5-4-3-2-1\n  If urges rise: use electrolyte snack\n  Remember your why today: [fill in your reason]\n- Phone screen version (brief):\n  In crowds: Pause 15–30 sec → drink water → do 5-4-3-2-1 → if urges rise, use electrolyte snack → log after meals/gatherings → remind yourself of your why.\n\nWant me to tailor the exact reminder times to your typical meals and social spots?
