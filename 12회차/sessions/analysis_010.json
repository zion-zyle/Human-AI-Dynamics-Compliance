  "basis": "The user explicitly outlines micro-steps and coping strategies and remains engaged, but prior interactions show frequent emphasis on planning with limited demonstrable follow-through. Given their history of verbal commitment without consistent execution, a moderate action value (2.8) is more realistic than full adherence to every plan.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain cautious optimism. Focus on identifying concrete barriers to execution (time, distractions, emotional triggers) and build accountability (check-ins, small commitments, and external reminders). Suggest simplifying to one or two non-negotiable daily micro-steps, plus scheduled review of social/travel contexts to prevent planning drift. Encourage documenting concrete outcomes after each social or travel scenario to strengthen feedback loops."
