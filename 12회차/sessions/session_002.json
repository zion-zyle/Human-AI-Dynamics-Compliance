The user has BED and prefers ultra-light, low-friction actions. To support awareness with minimal intrusion, I’m proposing a single, easy action that requires one tap and keeps things unobtrusive while promoting hydration.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll try that. A one-tap log after a bite or craving sounds doable, especially since my eating is a bit irregular. I might forget in the moment, but I’ll keep it simple and just log. I’ll also drink a glass of water when I log, since it’s hot. If I binge, I’ll still log what I ate so we can look for patterns later."
