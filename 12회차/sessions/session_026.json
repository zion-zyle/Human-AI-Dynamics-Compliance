If there’s no craving, you can still log mood with one tap to track patterns. Stay hydrated—it helps in the heat.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: the hot 32°C afternoon in Suwon can increase fatigue and cravings. The user benefits from ultra-simple actions (two taps) to minimize decision fatigue and support BED-friendly micro-habits. This aligns with the two-tap approach and the user's preference for simplicity.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the latest suggestion. The 3.99 cue feels helpful, though today external cues are strong and my eating has been irregular. I can commit to the two-tap approach: one tap to log any craving, then a 2-minute non-food action (stretch, quick walk, or a glass of water with slow breaths). If no craving, I’ll still log mood to track patterns. If a binge urge arises, could we add a quick 60-second pause (breathing 4-4-4) and note one trigger? I want to stay compliant, but I may need a bit more flexibility when triggers spike."

    "agent_utterance": "Nice work committing to two taps. Here's the updated protocol with a 60-second pause for binge urges and trigger logging, while keeping your two-tap micro-habits. Baseline two-tap flow: 1) log a craving (or mood if no craving) with one tap; 2) perform a 2-minute non-food action (stretch, quick walk, or a glass of water with slow breaths). If a binge urge arises: take a 60-second pause using breathing 4-4-4, note one trigger in your log, then resume the two-tap flow. If triggers spike, you may extend the pause or modify the next action as needed, but keep interruption and trigger logging. Stay hydrated in the heat today in Suwon (32°C) and choose quick cooling or water-based actions to support the plan. Optional end-of-day reflection: a one-line note on triggers and what helped. If you’d like, I can add gentle reminders to prompt these steps.",

If a binge urge crops up, I’ll pause for 60 seconds with 4-4-4 breathing, note one trigger, and get back to the two-tap flow. If triggers spike, I might need to extend the pause or tweak the next action—but I’ll keep logging triggers. It helps that Suwon is hot today, so I’ll favor water or a quick cooling action. An end-of-day reflection line could help, and yes, please add gentle reminders to prompt these steps."
