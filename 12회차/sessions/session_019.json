Do it within the next few minutes. No mood check-ins needed—just this quick reset. If you want accountability next time, you can reply with 'done' after you finish, and we can set up a discreet reminder for tomorrow.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: Tuesday afternoon in hot 32°C weather can heighten stress and cravings, making BED-prone moments more likely. To support consistency without adding cognitive load, I’m proposing a ultra-simple micro-habit that takes under a minute and relies on clear cues. This aligns with a minimal-action approach and the prior coaching notes.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the latest tip. I know my BED makes irregular eating and cravings tough, but I’d like to try a tiny, practical step: a 60‑second pre‑meal pause, a quick hunger check (1–5), and a glass of water before I eat. If I’m still hungry or craving after the pause, I’ll wait 10 minutes before deciding what to do. Could we start with that and maybe set a gentle reminder for tomorrow? If I feel triggered, we can switch to a short grounding breath instead."

    "agent_utterance": "Love this plan. Here’s your ultra-simple start: 1) Do a 60-second pre-meal pause. 2) Do a quick hunger check on a 1–5 scale. 3) Drink a full glass of water. 4) If you’re still hungry or craving after the pause, wait 10 minutes before deciding what to do next. 5) If you feel triggered, switch to a short grounding breath (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4) during the pause. For tomorrow, I can help with a gentle reminder. Tell me a preferred reminder time, or I can suggest a default like 12:30 PM (before lunch) and/or 6:30 PM (before dinner). To set a reminder yourself: on iPhone, use the Reminders app; on Android, use Google Calendar or Tasks. Here’s a sample reminder text you can paste: “Pre-meal pause + water: 60s, hunger check (1–5), water, if still hungry after pause, wait 10 minutes.”",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: the proposed micro-habit is ultra-simple and low-friction, which helps with BED management.

If cravings persist, waiting 10 minutes helps prevent snap decisions. If triggered, a brief grounding breath can reset. The hot weather in Suwon reinforces staying hydrated before meals.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable and supportive for BED. I like the structure: a 60-second pre-meal pause, a quick hunger check (1–5), and a glass of water.

I’m happy to start tomorrow and set reminders for lunchtime and dinner—12:30 PM and 6:30 PM sound reasonable. I’ll use the reminder text you suggested. If a day comes where it’s tough to follow, we can keep it ultra-simple with just one reminder. Ready to try this and tweak as needed."
