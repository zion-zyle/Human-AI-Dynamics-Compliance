  "basis": "The user explicitly commits to a minimal two-tap plan and frames it as ultra-simple, aligning with prior intent to keep actions small and doable. This suggests a high likelihood of follow-through, though BED context means occasional drift is possible. The two-tap pattern fits their stated preference and past emphasis on simplicity.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain the two-tap frictionless setup and reinforce micro-habits (e.g., quick log immediately after craving). Encourage brief end-of-day reflection to capture patterns without adding effort. If adherence dips, introduce tiny prompts (e.g., a scheduled reminder) and consider optional lightweight logging of intensity or mood only when craving spikes. Continue to validate progress and adjust only as needed, keeping the plan sustainable and BED-friendly."
