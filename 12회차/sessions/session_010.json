Right after, quickly log your mood and urge to reinforce your awareness. This micro-commitment helps prevent bigger urges and supports steady energy.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal thought process, but here's a concise rationale: it's Tuesday afternoon in Suwon and it's hot (32°C), which can increase fatigue and urge experiences. A quick, low-effort micro-commitment is typically most doable in this moment. The plan uses a brief pause, hydration, and a small, balanced snack with a quick mood/urge log—aligned with BED support and your energy level, making it easier to stay on track in the current weather and time.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I can try that. A 60-second pause, then a small, balanced snack and a quick mood/urge log sounds doable.

I’ll keep it simple and monitor how I feel, especially when I’m stressed, using this micro-step to prevent bigger urges."

    "agent_monologue": "I can't share the exact internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: in Suwon it's hot and mid-afternoon, which can heighten stress and cravings.

Logging mood and urge after the micro-step strengthens self-awareness and helps prevent bigger urges.",
    "user_utterance": "That makes sense. If cravings feel strong, I’ll try the quick 1-minute pause for breathing first, and if I still feel the urge, I’ll add a short 2-minute walk.
