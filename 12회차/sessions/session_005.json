Here is a brief, high-level rationale: it's Tuesday afternoon in Suwon with hot weather (32°C), which can heighten urges and lower motivation. Given BED and moderate emotional sensitivity, a tiny, low-effort action is safest. The planned numeric cue around 2 points suggests a 2-minute check-in. So I’m proposing a short urge-surfing check-in of about 2 minutes plus a simple, ready-to-grab snack to prevent a binge spike.",
    "user_utterance": "I like the urge-surfing approach. I'll try the 2-minute check-in after my next bite. I'll name the urge, rate it 0–10, and then grab a small, grounding snack with water instead of reaching for something binge-worthy. If I'm not hungry yet, I'll still do a quick check-in and plan the next bite. Today I'm feeling a bit stressed and the heat isn't helping, so I'll keep it simple—cold water or iced tea and a shaded break first, then the snack if the urge is strong. If the urge hits around 7+, I'll pause for a couple of slow breaths before deciding what to do."
