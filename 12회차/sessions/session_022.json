Here are ultra-tiny, doable steps you can start today: 1) Pick three regular meal times that fit your day in Suwon and write them in your tracker (for example, 8:00 AM breakfast, 12:30 PM lunch, 7:00 PM dinner) and keep them consistent for now; adjust gradually if needed. 2) Plan a small, satisfying snack after dinner (examples: 1 small apple with a tablespoon of peanut butter, or a 100–150 kcal yogurt) and have it ready after dinner. 3) When a craving or urge hits: pause for 2 minutes, take 4 slow breaths, and log the urge in your tracker (time, trigger if you can name it, and an intensity 1–5). If the urge persists, do a 5–10 minute walk or grounding (try 5-4-3-2-1). 4) Set quick reminders: one in the morning to confirm meal times, one after dinner to have your snack ready, and one near typical craving times to use the urge-pause-log routine. 5) Tomorrow check-in: we’ll review what worked and tweak the plan. If you’d like, we can aim for a 10-minute check-in around the same time tomorrow in Suwon time. Tip for today: stay hydrated in the heat and keep snacks easily accessible to reduce friction.",

Shift the upcoming meals by 15–30 minutes and update your tracker and reminders. If you miss multiple meals over a couple of days, re-establish the three-meal pattern within the next 24–48 hours.\n- If cravings persist after a 5–10 minute walk: add a tiny step before escalating. Try one of these ultra-short options: (1) 60 seconds of grounding (focus on senses), or (2) a quick distraction activity (1 minute of a simple chore or a brief phone-free reset). Rotate as needed, but keep each step very brief.\n- Tomorrow check-in: keep it around the same time but stay flexible. Aim for a 60-minute window around your planned time; if that’s not possible, reschedule to the next feasible time today.\n- Hydration in heat and keeping snacks ready: in 32°C heat, sip water regularly (target roughly 200–250 ml every 30–40 minutes) and consider an electrolyte drink if you’re sweating a lot. Carry a reusable bottle and set gentle reminders. For snacks, prep a simple post-dinner option (e.g., yogurt + berries or an apple + peanut butter) and keep a small stash of grab-and-go snacks (nuts, cut veggies) within easy reach.\n- If you’d like, I can help you set up quick reminders or a one-page printable checklist to keep you on track today.",

    "agent_utterance": "Extra tips for staying motivated when traveling or at social meals (keep them ultra-simple and doable):\n\nBefore you go or when you’re deciding what to order:\n- Pack a small snack kit you can take anywhere (e.g., a handful of nuts, a piece of fruit, a granola bar, string cheese). This reduces pressure to eat whatever’s available and helps you stay within your routine.\n- Hydration plan: carry a reusable bottle and sip 200–250 ml every 30–40 minutes in heat; add electrolytes if you’re sweating a lot. A cold bottle handy helps too.\n- Map your three meals around local times if you’re in a new place, but keep the shift window at +/- 15–30 minutes. If you miss a meal, shift instead of restarting.\n\nDuring meals out or social situations:\n- Choose a balanced option (protein + fiber), consider a smaller portion, and slow down to savor. You can opt to pause, breathe, and log cravings before deciding.\n- Use the urge-pause-log: pause 2 minutes, 4 slow breaths, then log the urge (time, trigger if named, intensity 1–5). If cravings persist after a 5–10 minute walk, add a 60-second grounding or quick distraction before escalating.\n\nSocial navigation tips:\n- Have a simple, honest cue ready (e.g., ‘I’m managing my eating triggers today, so I’ll keep portions small.’). If you’re comfortable, partner with a friend for accountability.\n\nQuick coping if cravings spike:\n- Do a 60-second grounding (notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear) or a brief distraction (stand up, stretch, a short easy task).\n\nPost-travel reset:\n- Re-establish your routine within 24–48 hours after travel to minimize drift.\n\nPattern spotting and motivation:\n- Use your mood/trigger notes to identify patterns (heat, fatigue, social pressure) and adjust reminders or timing accordingly.\n- Celebrate small wins: logging within 3 minutes of an urge, sticking to a snack after dinner, or successfully shifting a meal by 15–30 minutes.\n",
