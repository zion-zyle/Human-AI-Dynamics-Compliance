  "basis": "Based on a consistent history of engaging in micro-steps, logging urges, and applying coping strategies across many days, despite BED and heat, the user has demonstrated high probability of following through. While slips occur occasionally, the pattern shows a strong tendency toward action rather than mere verbal agreement.",
  "coaching_notes": "Reinforce the positive momentum with specific prompts and small, deterministic steps. For BED, incorporate explicit urge-management contingencies (e.g., if urge > 6, perform 2 minutes of breathing and log, then hydrate, then log again). Consider environmental supports (pre-portion cooling snacks, have water readily available, plan meals). Maintain a supportive, non-judgmental tone and check in on mood and sleep, as these factors influence urges."
