During that pause, take 4 slow breaths, drink a glass of water, and log one trigger or feeling (e.g., what happened just before the urge, or what you’re feeling right now). Keep it to 2 minutes max. If possible, share a quick note with someone for accountability. We'll adjust if needed, and you’re doing great already.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my detailed internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale. It’s a hot, energy-draining afternoon in Suwon (32°C), and you have BED with moderate emotional sensitivity. Small, highly actionable steps minimize friction and increase follow-through. A 2-minute post-bite pause with quick logging provides structure, accountability, and data to fine-tune later.",
    "user_utterance": "I like the plan. I'll try to implement it after my next bite: a 2-minute pause, 4 slow breaths, a glass of water, and logging one trigger or feeling. I’m concerned 2 minutes might feel long during a strong urge, so I’d like to start with 1–2 minutes and adjust as needed. I’ll reach out to a friend for accountability, and I’ll keep the trigger log simple (e.g., 'stressed after work' or 'urge to snack'). If I struggle, can we adapt with a quick distraction (walk, stretch) instead of logging? Thanks for the steady, small-step approach—I want to try this tonight."
