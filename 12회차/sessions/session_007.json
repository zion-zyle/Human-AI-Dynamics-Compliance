Tip: with 32°C heat, stay in a cool space and keep water handy.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice job adjusting tonight. Quick, simple guidelines for eating when you’re away from home or socializing: 1) Before you go, set a meal/ snack plan based on regular times. If meals shift, bring a balanced snack you’d actually enjoy. 2) At restaurants or with friends, aim for a half-plate of veggies, a palm-sized portion of lean protein, and a small portion of complex carbs; ask for sauces on the side and avoid fried or ultra-sweet items. 3) Use your 2-minute pause and 15-minute rule: pause, log cravings, reach out to your accountability partner, then decide. Hydrate first—water or in cooler spaces—especially in 32°C heat. 4) Social tips: eat slowly, sip water between bites, and keep portions modest; if alcohol is involved, space it with water and set a limit. 5) If a meal gets missed, choose a balanced snack rather than a large, calorie-dense option. 6) Carry a quick-access snack (nuts, fruit) and a small card with your goals to reference in social settings. 7) Keep accountability updates brief: text your partner after meals or cravings to stay connected.",

I’ll keep using the 3/10 log, followed by the 15-minute pause, and I’ll text my accountability partner after cravings or meals. If I miss a meal, I’ll aim for a balanced snack rather than a large one. A quick, concrete guideline for eating away from home would help—could we add that?
