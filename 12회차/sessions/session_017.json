    "user_utterance": "Thanks, I can try that. I’ll start with 250 ml of water now and a small protein snack (like yogurt or a hard‑boiled egg). I’ll do the 2‑minute reset (4 seconds in, 4 out) and a quick stretch if I feel restless. If cravings come back after 10–15 minutes, I’ll go for a short 5‑minute walk in the shade or switch to a distraction. I’m hoping these steps help with the binge urges, especially later in the day. If we could add a simple evening plan with a pre‑portioned snack and a quick calming activity, that might help me stay on track. Please remind me if I start skipping the steps."

If you’d like, pair with a short mindful walk in shade. - If cravings recur: repeat the 2-minute reset and consider a brief 5-minute walk or another distraction. - Accountability reminder: I can prompt you if you skip steps—tell me preferred reminder times (e.g., 7:15 PM and 9:00 PM) and I’ll include quick check-ins in our chats.",

Late-day cravings can be tricky with BED, so I’m glad there’s a plan for it. For reminders, 7:15 PM and 9:00 PM would work for me—please nudge me if I’ve skipped any steps. If I miss a step, I’ll do a quick catch-up in the chat and adjust, and I’d appreciate flexibility to move timings by about 15 minutes if my evening schedule shifts."
