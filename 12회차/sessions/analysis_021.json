  "basis": "The user articulates a structured, flexible plan with adjustable delays, logging, urge-intensity rating, trigger naming, and offline options, plus a suggested mid-day check-in. However, given their history of verbal commitment with travel/heat contexts and potential variability in adherence, a moderate likelihood of real-world follow-through is expected.",
  "coaching_notes": "Encourage ultra-specific micro-commitments (e.g., 'I will log within 3 minutes of an urge'), automate reminders, and build in social accountability. Provide a simple pre-travel checklist and ensure offline logging remains seamless. Emphasize quick, low-effort coping steps and tangible triggers to help adjust delays in real time. Monitor urge intensity and triggers to tailor prompts and delays for ongoing adaptability."
