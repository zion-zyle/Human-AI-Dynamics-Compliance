Choose one: (a) drink a tall glass of water, (b) do 2 minutes of deep breathing or a quick body check, or (c) have a small cooling snack like sliced apple or cucumber. If a slip happens, offer yourself a kind moment, log it later, and reset with your next micro-step.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: the hot Suwon afternoon on a Tuesday can sap energy and heighten BED risk. A tiny, concrete target—log once and do one micro-step—minimizes decision fatigue and keeps momentum, adapting to potential slips with a compassionate reset.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll go with (b)—2 minutes of deep breathing and a quick body check to reset. I’ll log this moment now and use the breathing to ride out any urge before the next meal. If I slip today, I’ll be kind to myself and reset with the next micro-step."

    "agent_utterance": "Nice work logging and choosing a 2-minute breathing reset. Try this simple 2-minute flow now: inhale through the nose for 4 seconds, pause for 2 seconds, exhale through the mouth for 6 seconds; repeat for 2 minutes. As you breathe, scan your body from head to toe and soften any tension. After the breath, rate your urge on a 0-10 scale and decide your next micro-step (log again, sip water, or have a tiny cooling snack if you're hungry). You’re doing well in this hot afternoon—be kind to yourself if a slip happens and reset with your next micro-step.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: In Suwon's heat (around 32°C) and with BED considerations, a tiny, low-effort micro-step is most likely to be doable right now. A 2-minute breathing plus a quick body check helps regulate arousal and urge without adding friction. This aligns with your plan to log now and reset with kindness if slips occur.",
    "user_utterance": "Breathing felt grounding and I can use this to ride out urges. I logged it and did a quick body scan; shoulders relaxed a bit. Urge is about a 3/10. My plan for the next micro-step is to sip a glass of water and check in again before my next meal. If I slip today, I’ll be kind to myself and reset with the next micro-step."

You're practicing good self-regulation this afternoon in the heat.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: in the hot afternoon in Suwon (32°C), a small, easy action like a glass of water helps hydration, reduces arousal, and supports urge management.

I'll propose a quick water sip and a brief urge check to maintain momentum and a compassionate approach for any slips.",
