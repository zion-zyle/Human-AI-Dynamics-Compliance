  "basis": "The user explicitly commits to implementing a ready-to-use template with adjustable reminders, log-luture option, slip-compassion elements, and weather/heat adaptations. This shows clear intent and a high likelihood of action, though practical execution may vary on very busy days.",
  "coaching_notes": "Encourage concrete, small wins and an easy log-later flow to maintain momentum. Emphasize a brief 'compassion moment' after slips and keep the slip protocol lightweight. Recommend a tiny daily target (e.g., log once and complete one micro-step). If needed, offer calendar-ready formats later. Probe potential barriers (time, stress) and pre-plan quick adjustments (shift times by 15 minutes, swap snacks, simplify prompts) to sustain adherence."
