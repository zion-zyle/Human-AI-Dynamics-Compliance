  "basis": "Past interactions show the user frequently vocalizes plans and intentions but has a history of limited follow-through. Their latest messages emphasize intent and flexibility rather than firm commitments or guaranteed actions, suggesting a moderate-low likelihood of full execution despite supportive language.",
  "coaching_notes": "To boost actual adherence: (1) break plans into ultra-simple, one-step actions (e.g., 'drink water now' rather than 'start with water and wait five minutes'); (2) set explicit, non-negotiable cues around meals and sleep, with small, trackable milestones; (3) increase accountability via quick daily check-ins, reminders, or a buddy system; (4) tailor strategies for BED, focusing on urge-surfing, alternative coping, and regular meal patterns within a flexible window; (5) identify specific triggers that derail plans and prepare ready-made alternatives."
