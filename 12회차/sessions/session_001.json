I know I tend to skip meals or snack poorly, so I’ll aim to do this at the first strong craving or after a workout.

Tips: pre-portion these so you can grab them quickly; aim to have the snack within 15–30 minutes after a workout or at the first strong craving. Hydration matters too—drink a glass of water first if you’re unsure whether you’re hungry or thirsty. For logging, try a simple note: Time, Craving intensity (1–10), Snack chosen, Craving resolved? Yes/No, any apparent trigger. This helps identify what works best. I can also send a quick nudge later in the day at your high-risk times (e.g., after workouts or mid-afternoon) if you’d like. Tell me your preferred nudge times and I’ll set them up.",

    "agent_utterance": "Love the flexibility. Here’s a practical, quick-start plan you can implement now, with adjustable reminders and a short BED coping kit:\n\nReminders that are adjustable/snoozable\n- Post-workout snack reminder: set for 30–60 minutes after your workout. On days your workout time shifts, simply adjust this reminder to 30–60 minutes after your actual end time.\n- Mid-afternoon reminder: set for 3:00 PM daily.\n- Evening check-in: set for 8:30 PM daily.\nTips to enable snooze and quick swaps:\n- iPhone: Use the Reminders app for the three reminders. When a reminder fires, you can snooze a notification by tapping the notification’s Snooze option (if available) or quickly edit the reminder time to a new time. For more automation, you can add a Shortcut that prompts you to input your workout end time and then updates the post-workout reminder time accordingly.\n- Android: Use Google Calendar or Google Tasks. Create three events/tasks with notification alerts. If your workout ends later, drag the event time to the new end time + 30–60 minutes. The notification will offer a Snooze option if supported by your device.\nIf you’d like, I can tailor these steps to either iPhone or Android—just tell me your device.\n\nQuick non-food coping options (real-time BED help)\n- 5-minute brisk walk or light walk around the block\n- Gentle 1–2 minute stretch (neck roll, shoulder rolls, spinal twists)\n- A warm cup of herbal tea\n- Splash of cold water on face or wrists\n- 1-minute grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste\n- Quick body scan from toes to head (notice tension and release)\n- 30 seconds of deep, slow breathing (inhale 4, exhale 6)\n\nUrge-surf prompt (brief)\n- “I notice the craving is here, but cravings are waves. I’ll ride this one out with a few breaths and a small, planned snack if needed.”\n- “This urge is uncomfortable, not dangerous. I can wait 2–3 minutes and choose a mindful option.”\n\nDaily encouragement nudge (example, you can customize)\n- “Nice work planning your day. Each mindful choice builds lasting progress—you’ve got this.”\n\nNext steps\n- You can begin by setting up the three reminders as discussed. When workouts shift, update the post-workout reminder to 30–60 minutes after your actual end time.\n- Share your device (iPhone or Android) and preferred apps (Reminders, Calendar, Tasks, etc.), and I’ll tailor exact, step-by-step setup instructions.\n- If you’d like, I can also add a simple daily check-in reminder (e.g., “How was today’s plan?
