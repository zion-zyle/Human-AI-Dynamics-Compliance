  "basis": "The user repeatedly commits to practical steps (printable checklist, urge-pause-log, 15–30 minute meal shifts) and plans to report back tomorrow. They show steady motivation and structured thinking, especially around travel and social meals. However, actual follow-through in real-life settings remains uncertain, particularly under travel/social pressure, so a mid-to-high action estimate is prudent.",
  "coaching_notes": "Leverage their preference for gradual steps: keep one social-meal plan at a time, bundle micro-commitments (e.g., 'log urge within 2 minutes'), and use simple reminders. Reinforce mood/trigger notes to identify patterns (heat, stress). Enhance accountability with a buddy or quick check-ins. After travel, emphasize a 24–48 hour reset. Track concrete metrics (urges logged per day, meals shifted) to gauge progress and adjust support as needed."
