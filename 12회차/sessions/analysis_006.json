  "basis": "The user has repeatedly expressed concrete, doable plans and explicitly commits to tonight's attempt, including using an accountability message. History in this chat shows proactive engagement with small-step strategies and willingness to adapt (e.g., adding short distractions, moving to cooler spaces). This pattern supports a high action likelihood, though real-world adherence still depends on tonight's momentary factors (heat, urge strength).",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain the emphasis on tiny, concrete steps and accountability. Encourage a real-time check-in even if progress is small. Prepare a quick fallback plan for if urges spike (e.g., 1-minute reset before logging, or a brief non-eating pause). Reinforce consistency by scheduling a brief daily reflection and a brief, easy-to-send update to the accountability partner."
