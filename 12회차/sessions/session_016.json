Try this quick, low-effort plan: 1) Do a 2-minute box-breathing cycle (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4). 2) Drink 250 ml of cold water. 3) Log your urge and mood now. If the urge is still high (above 6/10), repeat another 2-minute breathing cycle, log again, and have a cooling, pre-portioned snack (e.g., cucumber slices, a small yogurt, or a piece of fruit) before logging once more.
