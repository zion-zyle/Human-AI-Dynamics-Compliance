However, the frequent hedging and travel-related caveats indicate they may not follow through consistently, placing the estimate around the middle rather than high.",
  "coaching_notes": "To boost today’s adherence: 1) lock in two concrete micro-commitments per social moment (pause + hydration) and one quick post-event log entry; 2) pre-pack a portable cooling/snack kit and keep it visible; 3) set calendar reminders or a timer to prompt pauses; 4) write a brief personal 'why' note for BED to remind you during urges; 5) after social meals, spend 1–2 minutes reflecting on what worked and what didn’t to reinforce patterns. If urges spike, consider a small electrolyte drink and ensure steady hydration throughout the day."
