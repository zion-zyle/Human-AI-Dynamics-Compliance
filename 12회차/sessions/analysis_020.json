  "coaching_notes": "Preserve flexibility (offset option and wake-based shifts) and quick toggles (longer log ON/OFF). Emphasize micro-commitments and automated reminders, especially for travel or social days. Consider adding brief check-ins after urges to reinforce logging and consolidate behavior change."
