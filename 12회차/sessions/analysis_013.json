  "basis": "The user has repeatedly demonstrated engagement with detailed plans, contingencies, and a commitment to report back. This suggests genuine intent and cognitive readiness to act. However, prior behavioral patterns in similar contexts show that real-time adherence can vary, especially given BED and irregular schedules; thus action is plausible but not guaranteed.",
  "coaching_notes": "Leverage ultra-simple cues and micro-check-ins at high-risk moments (before meals, urge onset). Emphasize accountability (brief daily or bi-daily check-ins with a friend/coach). Normalize occasional misses and plan quick, non-judgmental resets. Consider reducing cognitive load on busy days by pre-assembling a few go-to snacks and proofing reminders to auto-trigger."
