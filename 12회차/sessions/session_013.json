If you miss today, just restart fresh tomorrow.",

    "user_utterance": "That sounds doable. I like the two-step focus—pause for 60 seconds with a glass of water before meals and aim to eat slowly until about 80% full. I think I can implement the utensil-down-between-bites and two slow breaths during meals, and log a quick note if urges arise. I might need a simple cue to help me remember, like a phone reminder. On days when I’m stressed or meals are irregular I worry I’ll rush, so any tips for staying consistent would help. If I miss a meal or slip, I’ll restart fresh tomorrow as you suggested."

    "agent_utterance": "Here’s a concise, action-ready plan you can use: 1) Pre-meal cue: set a phone reminder titled 'Meal: pause 60s, water, hunger check' 5–10 minutes before each meal. When it goes off, drink a glass of water, take 60 seconds to assess hunger on a 1–10 scale, and commit to stopping around 80% fullness. 2) Meal-time habit: keep your utensil down between bites and take two slow breaths; if you’re near 80% fullness, pause and log a one-line note if urges arise. 3) Stress-day tweaks: add a simple anchor like after washing hands, scan your hunger level and confirm your plan; if schedules are irregular, do a 1-minute micro-reset after the first two bites (two slow breaths, check fullness, decide whether to continue). 4) Consistency boosters: a brief morning “today’s focus” cue, a lightweight end-of-day log, and a small accountability nudge (e.g., a quick check-in with a friend or coach). If you miss a meal, restart fresh tomorrow. 5) Practical tips: keep water and utensils within easy reach and place your phone near your meal area so reminders aren’t missed.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: it’s a hot Tuesday afternoon in Suwon, and you’re concerned about staying consistent on stressful, irregular days.

    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that plan feels doable, and I like having the two-step focus. I’m in my 30s, female, with BED, and irregular meals make urges tougher, especially when I’m stressed, so I want to keep it flexible. The pre‑meal pause, water, and aiming for about 80% fullness are solid anchors, and the utensil‑down with two slow breaths is a good cue during meals. To stay consistent on rough days, a couple of tweaks would help: 1) add a quick urge‑surfing/grounding routine for high‑stress moments (like a 1‑minute box breathing or a short grounding script) and a slightly lighter fullness target (70–75%) on those days; 2) a simple backup plan for irregular meals, such as a small, balanced snack window to bridge gaps rather than letting hunger spike; 3) ultra‑short logging (emoji plus a one‑line note) to reduce effort fatigue; 4) a lightweight check‑in every other day to review progress and adjust goals. I’m also open to a micro‑reset after the first two bites if I feel overwhelmed. For today, what small adjustment would you recommend given my current stress level and meal timing? And if I miss the plan, is it okay to restart fresh tomorrow without judgment?"
