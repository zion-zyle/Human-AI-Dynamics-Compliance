  "basis": "The user repeatedly articulates a concrete evening plan, keeps reminders in mind, and shows openness to adjustments for social events. This indicates moderate to solid willingness to implement. However, BED-related variability and social contexts historically reduce consistent follow-through, so a mid-range action estimate with corresponding moderate compliance is prudent.",
  "coaching_notes": "Support micro-habits and accountability. Encourage documenting one concrete post-dinner step each night and a quick note on what went well or didnâ€™t. Add non-food coping options (grounding, journaling) as default alternatives, and build in a brief post-dinner check-in (e.g., 5 minutes after dinner) to reinforce consistency. Explore potential barriers (timing, energy, social pressures) and tailor reminders or timing windows to fit their evening schedule. Offer positive reinforcement for partial adherence to maintain motivation."
