Recommending you to download/save the printable BED starter PDF and set a specific start date, paired with a short 2-minute daily log, provides structure with minimal friction and supports consistent follow-through.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the clear plan. I’m ready to try a simple-start approach. I’ll pick a start date this week—how about Thursday, Oct 16—and I’ll download the BED starter PDF to get the tracking set up. I’ll start the 2-minute daily log after meals or urges, noting what I planned to eat, the urge I felt, and one quick coping action. I’d appreciate a couple of reminders—after meals and a short evening check-in—so I don’t miss days. If I miss a day, I’ll just restart the next day and keep going.

    "agent_utterance": "Terrific plan. Here are a few easy tweaks to fit an irregular schedule and keep momentum: 1) Flexible reminders: set after-meal prompts to fire within 30–60 minutes after each meal (or after your last bite if meals shift). If your meals vary, anchor reminders to the meal events rather than clock times. 2) Simple log option: if 2 minutes isn’t feasible, use a 1-line log like 'Planned: X; Urge: Y; Coping: Z.' 3) Evening check-in: aim for a brief wrap-up around 9–10 PM or within an hour of bedtime, with 1–2 prompts such as 'Did I log today? What helped? One tweak for tomorrow.' 4) Quick prep: create a short staple-food list to reduce daily decision fatigue. 5) Micro-commitment: confirm the BED PDF download today and set Oct 16 as the start date. 6) On busy days, log after any urge or snack—even a one-liner. 7) If you miss a day, simply restart the next day and use a quick catch-up wrap-up rather than backdating. 8) Tech tips: use your phone reminders or calendar, and if typing is hard, use a quick voice note to capture the log.",

    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the practical tweaks—these feel doable with my irregular schedule.

Target a brief 9–10 PM evening check-in, but set a quick earlier prompt if your evening runs late.

After the last bite of a snack, log with the same fields as meals:\n  - Primary log (one-liner): Planned: Snack (e.g., almonds 15g); Urge: moderate; Coping: sip water and pause 2 minutes.\n  - Fallback option: if you can’t type, use the fallback log template: Planned: Snack; Urge: Y; Coping: Z [fallback].\n- Reminders: anchor the reminder to the end of the last bite of the snack, just like meals. If your snack is split, log after the final bite you eat. You can still add a quick note in the log about portion size if helpful.\n- Optional notes: add a [Snack] tag for easy review later, and use voice notes as you mentioned.\n\n2) Ready-to-use templates for the 9–10 PM recap\nChoose one style and stick with it, or rotate as you like. Here are ready-to-use options:\n\nTemplate A — Concise recap\nYesterday: Planned: X; Urge: Y; Coping: Z\n\nTemplate B — Recap with quick reflection\nYesterday: Planned: X; Urge: Y; Coping: Z.
