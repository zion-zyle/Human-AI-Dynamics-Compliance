To support this, set a reminder 15–20 minutes before your planned window and have a small, healthy option ready (water, a quick snack) plus a 1-minute breathing reset if urges spike.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here's a brief rationale: hot weather in Suwon and the afternoon timing can raise urges, especially with BED. Because the user tends to plan but struggle with follow-through, a ultra-simple, single-action micro-commitment is most likely to stick. The suggestion focuses on a minimal logging task and a quick coping cue to reduce overwhelm and improve adherence.",
    "user_utterance": "Appreciate the latest suggestion. I want to stay compliant, but BED makes irregular meals tricky, so can we translate this into a simple plan: set 3 regular meals, add one small, satisfying snack if needed, and build in a 5-minute pause before eating to check urges? I’ll use a 0–10 urge scale after meals and keep a short coping toolkit (water, deep breathing, quick walk). Also, tips for handling social or triggering situations would help."

    "user_utterance": "Appreciate the thorough plan—this feels doable and supportive for my BED. I like the 5-minute pre-meal pause, the urge tracking, and the quick coping toolkit. Because my eating is often irregular, I may need some flexibility with mealtimes (e.g., shifting by up to an hour if needed). Is it okay to adjust windows rather than rigidly sticking to exact times?\n\nA couple of quick questions: 1) for the 'one small snack' between meals, do you have a simple portion guideline (types and roughly how many calories or grams) to avoid triggering a bigger binge later? 2) in social/trigger situations, is there a script beyond 'I'm sticking with my plan tonight' that tends to feel most natural? 3) if urges are high despite the pause (e.g., 7–9/10), what's your recommended next step—additional coping, a brief post-meal delay, or something else?\n\nI'll start with Breakfast around 8:30, Lunch around 13:00, Dinner around 19:00, and I'll add a snack around 15:30 if urges arise. I'll log urges 0–10 after meals and stay hydrated in this heat. Looking forward to refining this plan with you."

    "agent_utterance": "Great questions. Here are practical, concise answers to keep you on track:\n\n1) Flexible windows: Yes—it's okay to adjust meal times by up to ±60 minutes. Aim to maintain roughly 4–5 hour gaps between meals. If one window shifts, adjust the subsequent meals accordingly rather than forcing a rigid clock. Continue logging to see how shifts affect urges.\n\n2) Snack portion guideline between meals: Target about 150–200 calories with a protein or fiber boost. Simple options (pre-portion to avoid overeating):\n- 1 small apple + 1 tablespoon peanut butter (~180 kcal)\n- 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt + 1/2 cup berries (~120–150 kcal)\n- 1 ounce almonds (~160 kcal)\n- 1 slice whole-grain toast with a thin slice of cheese (~150–170 kcal)\n\nGuideline: roughly 150–200 kcal, ~8–15 g protein if possible, plus some fiber. Pre-portion ahead of time to reduce impulsive eating.\n\n3) Social/trigger scripts beyond 'I’m sticking with my plan tonight':\n- 'I’d like a smaller portion or to share a dish, please.'\n- 'I’m choosing to stay with my plan and nourish my body.'\n- 'Water first, I’ll decide in 10 minutes.'\n- 'I’m savoring my choices tonight and want to pace myself.'\n- 'I appreciate the support, but I’m sticking with my plan.'\n- If pushed, you can add: 'I’ve got this, and I’ll join the group a bit later with a plan-compliant snack if needed.'\n\n4) If urges are 7–9 after the pause: try this escalation sequence:\n- Do 1–2 minutes of box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4) plus 1 glass of water. \n- Do a 5–10 minute light activity (a quick walk or gentle stretch).\n- Implement a 10–15 minute post-pause delay before deciding on eating; re-check urges after the delay.\n- If urges remain high, reach out to a trusted person for support. Consider a very small, pre-portioned snack (around 100 kcal) only if you feel it will reduce risk and not lead to a binge—then re-evaluate urges and continue with your plan.\n- Log the urge level and review patterns to adjust windows or portions as needed.\n\n5) Your proposed schedule and heat considerations: Breakfast around 8:30, Lunch around 13:00, Dinner around 19:00, optional snack around 15:30 if urges arise. Stay hydrated in the heat and aim for balanced meals with vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains.

What triggered them?\n  3) Did the 15:30 snack plan land as expected?
