    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the quick 2-minute micro-habit. With BED I think pausing before eating and checking whether I’m actually hungry (or just thirsty) could help me slow down. I’ll try your steps: a 60-second pause, one glass of water, then I’ll log the craving and plan a small, balanced snack if needed (100–150 kcal with protein and fiber). If I’m still hungry after the pause, I’ll choose that snack. My eating is a bit irregular, so I’d love light reminders that are flexible. Here are my typical meal times so you can tailor prompts: breakfast around 8–9am, lunch around 12–1pm, dinner around 6–7pm, and a snack around 3–4pm. In this hot weather I might skip meals, so please keep prompts gentle and adjustable. If I get a strong binge urge, maybe a quick 1-minute grounding exercise before deciding on food would help."
