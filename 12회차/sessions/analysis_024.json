  "basis": "The user shows clear, sustained planning and values gentle, flexible reminders (Soft mode, one-tap logging, post-binge routine). Historically, when plans emphasize ease and autonomy, actual follow-through tends to be moderate rather than full commitment; their emphasis on not overloading themselves and willingness to adjust suggests a realistic but not guaranteed adherence level.",
  "coaching_notes": "To boost real-world adherence, implement automatic or easily-switchable Soft mode in crowds (e.g., a single toggle that remains active). Keep the post-binge routine simple (60-second breathing reset as backup). Emphasize micro-goals (e.g., complete one reminder action per day) and lightweight logging (one-tap) to reduce friction. Pay extra attention to evenings by pre-setting lighter cues. Use brief daily reflections to reinforce progress and adjust reminders weekly based on comfort and outcomes."
