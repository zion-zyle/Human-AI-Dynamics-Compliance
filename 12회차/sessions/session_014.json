Do it slowly and breathe with the counts. 2) 60-second body scan: slowly notice tension from head to toe and release it as you exhale. 3) Quick distraction: 60 seconds of light movement (march in place, shoulder rolls, or a quick stretch) or sip a small glass of cold water. 4) If the urge remains after that, pause for a minute away from the kitchen, then log and we’ll choose the next micro-step together.",
