  "basis": "The user has repeatedly engaged in planning and stated a willingness to test a week with weekday/weekend variations, but there is no concrete evidence of consistent follow-through from past behavior. The commitment reads as feasible but not guaranteed to translate into action, placing the estimate in the middle range.",
  "coaching_notes": "To improve future follow-through: 1) strip to an ultra-simple micro-habit (e.g., 60 seconds of breathing + water) with zero-mood prompts on busy days. 2) automate reminders with clear, discreet cues and a single, non-negotiable daily trigger. 3) require a minimal progress check-in after the week (even a one-line recap) to build accountability. 4) identify and address specific barriers (time, energy, privacy) and adjust Weekdays vs Weekends timing to fit real routines. 5) consider adding a lightweight accountability buddy or share results to reinforce consistency."
