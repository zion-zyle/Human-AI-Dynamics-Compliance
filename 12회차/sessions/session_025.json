Option A: have a small protein-rich snack (about 100–150 g yogurt or a handful of nuts) and log it with one tap. Option B: do a 60-second breathing reset at a craving and log it with one tap. For evenings, set a light post-binge routine: 60 seconds of slow breathing + a quick 2-minute reflection, both with one-tap logging. Stay hydrated in this heat and keep your cues gentle and easy.",

    "user_utterance": "I’m glad for a tiny, doable goal. Given BED and my somewhat irregular eating, I’ll start with Option B today: a 60-second breathing reset at cravings and I’ll log it with one tap. If cravings linger, I’ll try a small protein snack (yogurt or nuts) and log that as well, with one tap. I’ve had a few days with lower consistency recently, so keeping it ultra-simple feels right and I’ll take this one step at a time."

    "agent_monologue": "Considering it's a hot afternoon in Suwon with potential energy dip, and given BED, I chose a low-friction, high-lidelity micro-action: a 60-second breathing reset at cravings. It's easy to start, reduces urge, and can be logged with one tap. Keeping a simple backup (a small protein snack) for lingering cravings aligns with the desire for ultra-simple steps and flexible logging. Weather and time factors support a minimal, consistent pattern rather than complex routines.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that plan feels totally doable for me. I’m going to start with the 60-second breathing reset at cravings and log it with one tap.

    "agent_monologue": "Context: it's a hot Tuesday afternoon in Suwon (32°C). The user has BED and prefers ultra-simple, low-friction actions. A 60-second breathing reset at cravings is a minimal, non-overloading entry point that can reduce urge intensity and logging friction. If cravings persist, a small protein snack remains a practical second step. Keeping the evening routine light (breathing + short reflection) preserves consistency without adding cognitive load. By inviting the user to share triggers, we can adjust gradually, which aligns with their flexible, autonomy-supportive style.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice plan. For minimal friction: log the 60-second breathing reset with one tap as you planned. If a craving sticks around and you want to capture a mood or trigger, use a separate one-tap entry for a quick trigger note (e.g., Mood: tired; Trigger: craving). Keeping the logs separate makes it easier to spot patterns over time. If you’d ever prefer, we can add a simple 'Trigger' field in the same log later, but starting with separate taps keeps things clean. Want me to set up a two-tap pattern (breathing log + trigger log) you can use anytime?",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here is a concise rationale: logging triggers can help identify patterns over time, and keeping trigger notes separate from the breathing log preserves data clarity. Given the goal of ultra-simple logging, using separate taps for the breathing action and for any trigger/mood notes helps you stay consistent while still enabling pattern analysis later. The warm weather and BED context make it helpful to capture these nuances without adding friction.",
