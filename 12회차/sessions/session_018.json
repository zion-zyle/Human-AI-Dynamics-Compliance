    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my detailed internal reasoning, but here's a brief, high-level rationale: given the hot weather in Suwon and BED considerations, a short, flexible post-dinner micro-habit with non-food coping options supports consistency without overdoing it.

Then do 60 seconds of box breathing and drink a glass of water. If you want more, you can add a short 5-minute indoor walk or gentle stretch. Since it’s warm (about 32°C) in Suwon, opt for indoor or shaded options and finish the evening with this micro-habit rather than a big overhaul.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: given the warm Suwon evening and your preference for simple, low-effort steps, a 5-minute post-meal check-in plus 60 seconds of box breathing and a glass of water are both feasible and BED-supportive. If you want more, a brief indoor walk can be added without overhauling your routine.",

    "agent_utterance": "Great idea to add a flexible reminder. Try this light cue system for tonight and moving forward: \n\n- Primary cue: set a reminder 15–60 minutes after you finish dinner titled “Post-dinner micro-habit.” Its message: “1-line went well; 1 thing to adjust; 60 seconds of box breathing; drink a glass of water.”\n- Flexible fallback cue: if you miss the dinner-time reminder, trigger the same routine after a nearby post-dinner task (e.g., after you clear the dishes or before brushing your teeth).\n- Visual cue: place a small sticky note on the fridge or front door with the prompt, so you see it as you head into the evening.\n- Quick format: “Went well: ______; Adjust: ______.”\n- Optional expansion: if you have a few extra minutes and feel up to it, add a 5-minute indoor walk or gentle stretch earlier in the evening, especially when it’s hot.\n\nTips: keep a glass of water ready, choose indoor/shaded options, and keep the reminder simple so it fits even on busy nights. Try it for a week and adjust timing or cues to what feels easiest for you.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: the user wants a light, flexible cue that can trigger the post-dinner micro-habit even on busy evenings.

    "user_utterance": "Thanks—that flexible reminder feels doable for busy evenings. I think a quieter cue would help me actually notice it without feeling nagged, so could we use a subtle push notification or a short vibration instead of a loud chime? I’d also like a tiny optional check-in about mood or triggers, like 'Went well; what emotion came up?' That could help me decide whether to add the extra 5-minute walk. The fridge sticky note is great; I could also add a reminder on my phone lock screen or a mirror note. If I miss the dinner cue, I’ll try the fallback after dishes or before brushing teeth. And if I miss two days in a row, could we reset to a simpler micro-habit at the next dinner? Looking forward to testing this for a week."

Here is a quieter, flexible cue plan to test for a week: Subtle cue options: enable a push notification with vibration or a quiet banner, or use a lock-screen reminder.

Tiny optional mood/trigger check-in: after the 60-second breathing and water, optionally note: 'Went well; what emotion came up?'

A couple tweaks I want to confirm: if dinner times shift on weekends, should the 15–60 minute post dinner window flex? If I miss two days, I will reset to the simplest micro-habit at the next dinner (60 seconds breathing and water only). Privacy note: it would be ideal if reminders stay discreet on a shared phone.
