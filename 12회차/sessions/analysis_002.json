  "user_action_estimate": 2.8,
  "compliance_estimate": 0.42,
  "confidence": 0.65,
  "basis": "The user repeatedly endorses a light, non-pressuring plan and emphasizes flexibility, voluntary activation of tools (e.g., reminders) and openness to reviewing patterns later. While this suggests some intent to engage, prior patterns (in similar BED-related contexts) often show variability and dependence on triggers and perceived pressure. With a predicted action around 2.8 and the last suggestion (opt-in, non-pressuring reminders) in mind, compliance is likely moderate rather than high. The calculation aligns with a mid-range action value and modest adherence probability.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a non-pressuring stance; offer optional, easily turn-offable nudges; check in for readiness before enabling features like reminders; focus on short, achievable logging goals; explore triggers and barriers without judgment; reinforce progress and review patterns to tailor support."
