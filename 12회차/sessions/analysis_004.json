  "basis": "The user has repeatedly proposed concrete check-ins, reminders, snack templates, and cooling strategies, with a clear plan to trial for a week. Historically, they show thoughtful planning and a readiness to adapt, but BED-related urges can still introduce non-adherence. The high level of specificity suggests strong intent, placing action around 4.0, while the moderate compliance estimate (~0.55) reflects some realistic risk of slips.",
  "coaching_notes": "Sustain momentum by: (1) keeping reminders simple and flexible (allow larger shifts beyond ±30 minutes if needed), (2) ensuring a reliable post-dinner check-in (2–3 minutes) and a quick pre-bed cue if urges persist, (3) expanding ready-to-grab snacks with dairy-free/low-FODMAP and other dietary-aware options, (4) adding a lightweight accountability check (quick log or recap after each check-in). Also reinforce urge surfing and non-judgmental language, and encourage logging triggers promptly to refine tomorrow's plan."
