    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the latest suggestion—2.73 feels like a doable, middle-ground nudge. I want to respond with something realistic for my BED pattern. Tonight I’ll try one small, planned step: I’ll set a scheduled snack time and prepare a simple go-to option (like yogurt with berries). When a craving hits, I’ll pause for 2 minutes, drink a glass of water, and if the urge persists, take a quick 5-minute walk or do a couple of slow breaths. I’ll log the urge on a 0–10 scale and note what helped. Since my eating is irregular, I might need flexible timing—could we build in a couple of alternative window options for days with later dinners? Also, could you share a couple more low-effort actions to choose from when stress spikes?"

Remember to log the urge on 0–10 and note what helped.\n\nLow-effort actions for stress spikes (choose 1–2 when cravings or stress hit):\n- 60-second box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4)\n- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste)\n- 60-second body scan to release tension (scan head to toes and soften each area)\n- A quick 1- to 2-minute walk or light stretch (even around the room)\n- Splash of cold water or a small sip of water to pause and reset",
