  "basis": "The user repeatedly articulates commitment and a clear plan, but also notes irregular eating and reliance on reminders. Past behavior isn't provided, so a mid-range estimate best reflects likely adherence given the stated barriers and need for prompts.",
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain clear, lightweight prompts and track actual entries (cravings/mood logs, 2-minute actions, and pause triggers). Encourage sharing meal times to tailor reminders, and gradually adapt reminders based on compliance signals. Reinforce the quick 2-minute habit and the 60-second pause to sustain adherence. Consider adding accountability check-ins and simplifying logging if consistency drops."
