  "basis": "The user continues to articulate a detailed, multi-step plan with logging, accountability, and contingency actions. While they express motivation and practical steps, there is no explicit record of consistent prior follow-through in this thread. Given BED risk, a moderate action value (around 3/5) reflects cautious optimism: they may implement parts tonight but may not fully sustain every element.",
  "coaching_notes": "Keep reinforcing a small number of high-impact steps (e.g., 2-minute pause, logging, quick accountability check-in) to reduce cognitive load. Encourage concrete tonight-only commitments (e.g., predefine go-to snack and meals) and a simple post-event check-in to review what worked. Consider adding a guaranteed pre-commitment or environmental cue to reduce decision fatigue when traveling or socializing. Monitor for over-ambitious plans and adjust to ensure each night remains doable; ensure support contacts are ready and responsive."
