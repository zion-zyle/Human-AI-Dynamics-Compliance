    "agent_utterance": "You're doing great—consistently near your goal. For handling late-night urges away from your routine, try a small, structured kit: carry a protein-rich snack or yogurt, drink a glass of water, and do a quick 5-minute wind-down (breathing or light walk) when cravings hit. This keeps you near the target with a manageable step (S=4.0). If you want, we can adjust your daily plan slightly later, but for now this is a gentle, high-lidelity move.",
