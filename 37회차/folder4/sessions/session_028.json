A simple, steady move today is to anchor your three meals at consistent times (e.g., breakfast 8–9, lunch 12–1, dinner 7–8) in Suwon, and carry a quick protein snack (yogurt, nuts, boiled egg) for moments of stress or social pressure. This gentle adjustment supports steadier intake and keeps you near your goal.",
