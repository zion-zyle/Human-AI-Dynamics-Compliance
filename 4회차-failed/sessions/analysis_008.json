Continue providing simple, actionable plans; offer a quick mood/heat log template and brief social/day-specific strategies (e.g., pre-order protein, carry pre-portioned treats, rehearse a brief self-talk). Reinforce progress with validation, and check in on mood/heat patterns to tailor tomorrow's plan."
