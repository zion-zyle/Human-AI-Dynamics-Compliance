  "user_action_estimate": 4.0,

  "basis": "User repeatedly affirms a concrete plan (drink water, plan a snack, log hunger/mood) and states they will check back in. Positive, proactive language and explicit commitment suggest a high likelihood of following the suggestion closely.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Low. The user expresses alignment with the plan and acknowledges BED while framing steps as achievable. Minor ambivalence about heat and BED is acknowledged but not acted on against the plan.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Few persistent negative beliefs. Occasional hedging (“I’ll try,” “BED is tough”) but not self-defeating narratives. Overall, optimistic and problem-focused.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Heat and urges are salient triggers; plan relies on hydration, simple options, and urge management (60-second pause). Stress about BED may arise but is mitigated by structured steps.",
  "effective_reinforcement": [
    "Empathy",

  "coaching_notes": "Maintain and reinforce the use of tiny, concrete steps (water, snack plan, log). Encourage consistency with quick urges-management tools (60-second pause). Consider prompting a brief check-in after the first hour to reinforce logging and reflection; offer additional simple snack alternatives to reduce decision fatigue."
