If you’re still hungry after the pause, have a small protein portion; if not, wait 15–20 minutes and reassess. I can also set up Sunday 9 AM reminders and an optional midweek check-in—tell me your preferred reminder channel and time.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: hot weather in Suwon and BED risk mean we should keep actions ultra-simple and quick to do. The three actions target hydration, protein intake, and mindful cue-checking—all helpful for satiety and reducing binge risk. They also align with the user’s preference for reminders and structured accountability.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the tips. I’m on board with hydration, protein-first, and the quick hunger check, but I’d like to tailor a few details: - Hydration: 500–750 ml in an hour is a lot for me. I’ll start with 250 ml now and 200 ml more in 30–40 minutes. - Protein-first: I’ll keep easy options (yogurt, boiled egg, cheese stick) handy at meals and when cravings hit. - Hunger check: I’ll try the 60-second pause and 3 breaths; if I’m still hungry after that, I’ll have a small protein portion and reassess after 15–20 minutes. If urges are strong, I’ll add a quick non-food coping step (a brief walk, 5-minute grounding exercise). Reminders: Sunday 9 AM works for me. I’d prefer WhatsApp nudges, and a midweek check-in would be helpful—maybe Wednesday 7 PM? I’m hoping these tweaks make it easier to stick with a plan this week."

    "agent_utterance": "- Craving-ready kit: keep your protein anchors (yogurt, boiled egg, cheese stick) within reach and pair each meal with protein plus fiber to blunt cravings. Have a small, planned protein-packed snack ready when cravings hit.\n- Extend and rotate the pause: your 60-second pause is great; if intensity spikes, do 2 minutes of box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4) and observe the urge without acting. Repeat once if needed.\n- Urge-surfer technique: instead of fighting the craving, observe its rise and fall for about 8–12 minutes. Describe it quietly to yourself (e.g., “urge rising, peak in 2 minutes, fading”). This reduces impulsivity.\n- Quick non-food coping (on tough days): 5-minute walk, 5-sense grounding exercise (notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste), or splash of cold water on wrists/face.\n- Delay-to-decide tool: set a timer for 10–15 minutes whenever a craving hits. If you still want something after that, choose a small protein portion; reassess after 15–20 minutes.\n- Hydration rhythm for heat: sip small amounts regularly (e.g., 100–150 ml every 15–20 minutes during peak heat) to stay baseline hydrated and reduce thirst-driven urges.\n- Prep for tough days: pre-commit to one protein-forward snack and one non-food coping step at your strongest times (e.g., late afternoon). If you break the plan, reset with a brief 5-minute walk and a fresh protein bite.\n- Environment and reminders: keep triggers minimized (pre-portioned snacks, visible water bottle). Use your WhatsApp reminders as nudges, not pressure, and report hunger/urges after meals to fine-tune.\n- Sleep and stress buffer: short afternoon rest or gentle stretch can lower baseline cravings; aim for consistent sleep to reduce emotional triggers.",

    "user_utterance": "Great question—here are ultra-quick ways to log triggers and emotions without adding much work. Pick one method and keep it in one place (WhatsApp or a notes app) so it feels seamless. Option A: one-tap mood log after cravings. Send a tiny line like: \"Mood: stressed; Sleep: 6h; Craving: 7/10; Trigger: late afternoon.\" Option B: three‑word snapshot after cravings. Either: \"Mood: stressed; Sleep: poor; Craving: high\" or save a template and fill in 1–2 words. Option C: one-line template you can copy-paste anytime: \"Trigger: [env/person], Emotion: [feeling], Hunger: [0–10], Sleep last night: [Xh], Craving: [0–10].\" Option D: a simple 0–10 craving scale plus two quick tags, e.g., \"Craving: 8/10 | Stress: 6/10 | Sleep: poor.\" For tough days, add a note like \"late-afternoon spike\" to help spot patterns. Quick tips: log as soon as the craving hits or right after a meal so you don’t forget; keep the template visible where you already look; do a 2‑minute daily review to spot trends; and most importantly, treat yourself with self-compassion—this is data to tailor your plan, not a judgment.
