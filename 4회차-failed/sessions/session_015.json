If logging isn’t possible, snap your mood/hunger and pick one of the options below. Hydration matters in the heat, too.\n\n1) 2-minute pre-breakfast breathing and mood check: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6; rate hunger 0–10.\n2) Choose one quick breakfast (aim ~300–400 kcal):\n   - A) Yogurt (plain Greek/Korean yogurt cup) with a small handful of berries or sliced apple + 1 tsp chia.\n   - B) 1 hard-boiled egg + 1 small fruit (banana or tangerine) + 8–12 almonds.\n   - C) Protein shake with water and a piece of fruit.\n3) If you’re rushing and can’t log, do the mood/hunger snapshot and go with one of the options above.\n4) Hydration: drink a large glass of water with breakfast, and another 250 ml later mid-morning if you can.\n5) Day 4 check-in reminder: we’ll review how this went and tweak reminders if needed.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my private chain-of-thought, but here is a brief, non-stepwise rationale: the hot, busy morning in Suwon increases decision fatigue and BED risk, so a ultra-simple, protein-forward breakfast plus a quick mood/hunger check helps prevent impulsive overeating. The context (32°C heat, Wednesday) supports a compact, reliable routine and leveraging Day 4 as a milestone.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the plan. The 2-minute breathing check plus a protein-forward breakfast feels doable. This morning I feel a 6/10 hunger and a bit stressed. I’ll go with option B (1 hard-boiled egg + 1 small fruit + 8–12 almonds) to start steady; if I’m rushed I’ll switch to option A. I’ll drink water with breakfast and use the breathing if urges come up. If I binge later, I’ll pause, breathe, and note my mood before deciding what to eat. Happy to adjust reminders if mornings shift."
