    "user_utterance": "Hi, thanks for checking in. I have BED, so I appreciate small, practical steps. Since there aren’t new recommendations yet, could we start with a simple plan: consistent meals, two planned snacks, and strategies to pause when urges come? I’m moderately compliant and easily influenced by my surroundings, so a routine that fits my day and a nonjudgmental tone would help."

    "agent_monologue": "My last question was about condition. The user's response indicates their condition is BED. Now, I will ask about the next unknown attribute: mu.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the check in. My pattern is moderately regular, but work and social plans can shift things. I typically aim for breakfast around 8, lunch around 1, and dinner around 7. I would like to add two planned snacks at roughly mid morning around 10:30 and mid afternoon around 3:30. I am more consistent when there is a routine, but I tend to get swayed by surroundings and urges, especially when grazing is easy. Here is a simple starter plan I can try this week: three consistent meals at about the same times (breakfast 8, lunch 1, dinner 7); two planned snacks at 10:30 and 15:30 with simple foods (fruit plus yogurt, a small handful of nuts, yogurt cup); a one minute pause when an urge hits: name the urge, take four slow breaths, then drink a glass of water. If still urgent, wait 10 minutes and switch to a quick pleasant task (stretch, a short walk, or a micro chore). Environment tweaks: pre portion snacks, keep trigger foods out of sight, set gentle reminders. If this feels doable, I will try it for a week and we can fine tune the times or options based on what helps most."

    "user_utterance": "I would set a 3 for this plan. It feels doable with my current routine and the two planned snacks, plus the pause technique and environment tweaks. I will commit to trying it for a week and then reassess: if most days go smoothly, I can aim higher (a 4) next week; if I struggle, I’ll tweak the times or snack options. I will also keep reminders to pause and hydrate. If urges feel overwhelming, I will extend the pause or swap to a quick pleasant task and give myself grace."
