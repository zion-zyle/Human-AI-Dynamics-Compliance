It’s hot in Suwon today, so let’s keep things simple and effective: 1) drink 250 ml of cold water now to hydrate and help curb heat-driven urges. 2) if you’re hungry, choose a quick, protein-rich snack with fiber (for example, a small yogurt cup or a handful of almonds with an apple). 3) log your hunger and mood in the app right after you eat, and take a 60-second pause before deciding what to do next.
