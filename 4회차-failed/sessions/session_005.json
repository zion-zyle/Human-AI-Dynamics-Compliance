The steps are intentionally brief and easy to start now, with a quick check-in to support accountability.",

The small snack option is helpful, and I’ll log cravings and mood to spot patterns. If cravings stick around after 5 minutes, I’ll aim for a short walk in the shade. I’ll try this today and check back on how it went so we can tweak as needed."

I kept box breathing to about 1 minute since I felt a bit overwhelmed, and I used 5-4-3-2-1 grounding when urges came. I logged cravings and mood, which was helpful. I tried the apple with peanut butter, but cravings persisted, so I did a 10-minute walk in the shade as planned. I’d love a few more quick, high-protein snack options on hand (string cheese, a small yogurt cup, hard-boiled eggs, or a handful of almonds) and a couple of super-simple meal tweaks (like adding a protein at lunch). A 2-minute pre-snack check-in would also feel helpful. On hot or social days, I’ll aim for a 5–10 minute walk plus a quick breathing reset before snacks.
