    "user_utterance": "Got it—this plan feels doable today. I’ll start with 250 ml of water now and keep a bottle with me in the heat. I’m going to try the 30-second hunger rating before snacks or meals; if I’m at 4–7 I’ll grab a small option (apple, yogurt, or 10 almonds). In crowds, I’ll use a quick 1-minute breath pause to slow impulses. After eating, I’ll jot a line about what triggered the choice and how I felt. A couple quick questions: if stress makes me misread hunger, could we add a quick reflex check (like a water sip or a 2-minute pause) before deciding? And if I don’t love those snack options, is it okay to swap in other small, similar-calorie choices? Thanks!"
