    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the clear plan. It feels doable today. I’ll start with a big glass of water and a protein-rich breakfast—if mornings are tight, Greek yogurt with fruit works too. I’ll use the 5-4-3-2-1 reset when cravings spike and keep a small snack packed (yogurt cup or almonds). I’ll rate cravings 1–10 and log triggers, and if I slip I’ll treat it as data and adjust, not give up."

Here's a quick, doable plan you can follow now:\n- Start with 500 ml cold water.\n- Breakfast: Greek yogurt with fruit (about 1 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup berries) or your preferred protein yogurt.\n- Craving buffer: keep a small yogurt cup or a handful of almonds ready to go.\n- Use 5-4-3-2-1 grounding if cravings spike: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.\n- Log cravings: rate 1–10 and jot one trigger.\n- If you slip, treat it as data and adjust tomorrow.\n- Heat tips: sip water with ice, stay shaded; if mornings are tight, rely on yogurt with fruit and a quick snack instead of a full meal.\nWant me to generate a simple log template you can copy each day?",

I will propose a concise, actionable set of steps aligned with that plan and add quick heat-adaptation tips.",

I appreciate the ultra-fast fallbacks—having a small yogurt cup with fruit or a ready-to-drink shake on busy mornings should help me avoid impulsive grabs.

The copy-paste one-line log is perfect for rushed days, and the weekly summary will be useful for spotting trends over time. A couple of tweaks I might find useful: on days when I’m extra rushed or very wound up, could we keep the breathing to 1–2 rounds and use the fallback as a minimal log line? Also, after a slip, I’d like a simple optional “recovery steps” line to document what I did to regain balance. And for contexts like work or a crowd, having Context optional would help me keep it brief. I’ll start today and treat slips as data to inform tomorrow.
