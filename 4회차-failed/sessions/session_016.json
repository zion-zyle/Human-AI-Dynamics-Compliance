Here’s a simple three-step boost for this hot morning: 1) drink a glass of water now (about 250–300 ml) to hydrate, 2) have a small, balanced snack with protein and fruit (e.g., yogurt with berries or a handful of almonds and an apple), 3) log your hunger/urge level and a quick mood note. If you’re pressed for time, start with B (breath/reset and the log) and do the snack a bit later. You’ve got this—let me know how you feel after these steps.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t reveal my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: it’s a hot Wednesday morning in Suwon (32°C) with BED considerations and a history of mornings being variable. A low-effort hydration + small, balanced snack + quick log aligns with your three-action plan and minimizes cognitive load, supporting mood and reducing urge risk. If mornings shift, you can start with the quick reset (B) and switch to the snack (A) when you have more time.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’m going to try to follow the latest suggestion. I’ll start with a glass of water now, aim for a small balanced snack with some protein and fruit later, and then log my hunger and mood. If I’m pressed for time, I’ll at least do the water and the log and plan the snack for a bit later. I know I benefit from simple options, so two reliable snack ideas I can rotate are yogurt with berries or a handful of almonds with an apple. I’ll check back in after I try it."

    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: hot weather increases dehydration risk and BED triggers may be amplified in the morning.

    "user_utterance": "Nice, that’s a practical plan for today. Hydrating now, sticking to a simple protein+fruit snack later, and logging your hunger and mood are good anchors—especially with BED. Your go-to snack ideas (yogurt with berries or almonds with an apple) are straightforward and easy to rotate, which can reduce decision fatigue. If urges spike, try a quick 60–second pause, label the urge, and choose one of your planned options instead of reacting impulsively. If you’re pressed for time, at least do the water and the log and schedule the snack for a bit later. Be gentle with yourself—progress isn’t perfect, and each step helps you learn. Tell me how it goes after you try it or what you log."
