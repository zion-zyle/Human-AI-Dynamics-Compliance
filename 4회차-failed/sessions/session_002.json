For example, around 9:30–10:00, choose one of: 1) Greek yogurt (about 150 g) with berries, or 2) a hard-boiled egg with a small fruit. Before snacking, do a 60-second cue-check: Am I truly hungry, or am I stressed or bored? If I'm not hungry, skip the snack; if I am, proceed with the protein option and log it. Keep it simple and stay hydrated in this hot weather.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share a detailed chain-of-thought, but here is a concise rationale: it's a hot morning (32°C) in Suwon, and you're on a tight, structured plan with a fixed snack window and cue-checks. To support BED management with minimal mental load, I prioritized a quick hydration step plus a simple, protein-rich snack within your window. This targets satiety, reduces the temptation for impulsive eating in warm conditions, and keeps you aligned with your established routines.",
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I appreciate the plan. Hydration first and a protein snack in the window sounds doable. I’ll aim for about 9:30–10:00 and pick between Greek yogurt with berries or a hard-boiled egg with a small fruit. I’ll do the 60-second cue-check before snacking: if I’m not truly hungry, I’ll skip and log nothing; if I am, I’ll choose the protein option and keep the portion simple. My worry with BED is urges during stress, so could we add a quick pause-and-breathe (like 4-4-4) when cravings hit? If today feels rough, maybe we have a fallback plan (water and a short walk) instead of snacking."

    "agent_utterance": "Fantastic plan. Here's a small, quick update for today: when cravings hit, do a 4-4-4 pause-and-breathe for up to 60 seconds to calm the urge. If the craving remains, try the fallback: drink a glass of water (about 250–350 ml) and take a 5–10 minute walk. If you’re within your 9:30–10:00 snack window, proceed with your protein option (Greek yogurt with berries or a hard-boiled egg with a small fruit) in a simple portion, after confirming with a quick 60-second cue-check. If today feels rough or you’re not truly hungry after the breathing, skip snacking and log nothing, focusing on hydration and movement instead. Stay hydrated in the heat (32°C) and give yourself grace if things feel off.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here's a concise rationale: given BED and stress, a quick, low-effort coping sequence helps regulate urges in hot weather. The 4-4-4 breathing offers immediate nervous-system calming, and a water + short walk provides a safe fallback if cravings persist. This aligns with your plan and keeps today manageable.",
    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the plan. I like having a 4-4-4 pause when cravings hit—that feels doable. I’ll try it, and if the craving doesn’t pass I’ll use the water and a 5–10 minute walk as a fallback. Today I’m aiming for the 9:30–10:00 snack window and will choose between Greek yogurt with berries or a hard-boiled egg with a small fruit, after a quick 60-second cue-check. If things get rough, I’ll skip snacking and log nothing and focus on hydration and movement. Could we add a quick mood check-in later today or a simple log prompt to track how the breathing goes?"

    "agent_utterance": "Great idea. Here’s a simple mood check-in and breathing log you can use later today. Set a quick reminder for around late afternoon (e.g., 4:00 PM). Use these prompts:\n- Mood check-in: 'Late-afternoon mood (1–5). Any triggers or insights? Was the 4-4-4 breathing helpful (yes/no)?'\n- Breathing log (after any 4-4-4 attempt): 'Did I do 4-4-4? (Yes/No). Calming rating after breathing (1–5). Craving level before and after (0–10). Any notes or observations?'\nOptional: keep it to one short sentence for mood and a two-sentence note for the breathing log to minimize cognitive load.\nIf today feels rough, you can still complete the mood check-in and log; it helps you track what supports you best.",

  },
  {

    "agent_utterance": "Great question. I’d suggest making craving logging optional but, if you can, track both before and after the 4-4-4 breathing to gauge its impact. If that feels like too much, start with after-breathing only. Quick prompts you can use: Before 4-4-4: Craving (0–10); After 4-4-4: Craving (0–10); Calming rating after (1–5). Keep the mood check-in at 4:00 PM brief as planned. This keeps your data useful without overloading you.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my detailed internal reasoning, but here’s a brief rationale: logging craving levels before and after the 4-4-4 breathing can help you see if the breathing actually lowers urges.

A couple quick tweaks I’m considering: if a busy morning makes the window hard to hit exactly, is it okay to use a flexible 9:00–11:00 window? For craving logging, I’ll try to track before and after the breathing, but I may start with after-only if that feels heavy.
