    "agent_utterance": "Today’s quick plan (hot morning, easy wins): 1) Start with a big glass of water (about 500 ml) to hydrate and curb cravings. 2) Have a 2-minute, protein-forward breakfast: options include Greek yogurt with berries, a hard-boiled egg with a slice of whole-grain toast, or a ready-made protein shake. 3) After breakfast, do a 2-minute urge-check: name the craving, rate it 0–10, and pick one non-food fix for the next 10 minutes (drink more water, splash cold water on your face, or do a quick stretch). Optional: log the meal so you have a data point for tomorrow.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: the hot morning and BED sensitivity make ultra-simple, protein-first steps with a quick urge-check most sustainable. This plan is low-friction and keeps logging optional to reduce friction.",
    "user_utterance": "That plan sounds doable. Hydration first thing and a quick protein breakfast feels like a solid, non-intimidating start. I do have BED, so I’m glad you included a simple urge-check and a quick non-food fix after breakfast—that part feels doable on busy mornings. A couple of tweaks to keep me on track: if I’m still ravenous mid-morning, could we add a small, portion-controlled protein snack or a fiber-rich option? Also, I’d like a quick grounding option if urge spikes (like 4-4-4 breathing or a 5-minute walk) rather than reaching for food. I’ll try the urge-check, log what I eat to learn patterns, and report back how it went today."

    "agent_utterance": "Nice plan. Here are quick, doable tweaks for today: If you are still ravenous mid-morning after breakfast, choose one small portion-controlled option or a fiber-rich choice (about 100–180 kcal). Examples: 1) 1 small Greek yogurt (90–110 kcal) with a few berries; 2) 1 string cheese plus 1 small apple; 3) 1 hard-boiled egg with cucumber sticks; 4) 1/2 cup edamame; 5) 1 medium pear or 1 small high-fiber bar. For urge spikes, use one of these grounding methods: 4-4-4 breathing for 1–2 minutes or a 5-minute walk (indoors if the temperature is too hot; in shade or AC). After breakfast, continue the urge-check and log your intake to identify patterns. Stay hydrated throughout the day, and we can adjust based on how today goes.",
