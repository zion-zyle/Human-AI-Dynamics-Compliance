If cravings come up, choose a hydrating, light option like watermelon or cucumber. End the day with a short post-dinner check-in to note how satisfied you felt and plan for tomorrow.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief rationale: with hot weather (32°C) in Suwon on a Wednesday morning, a low-effort plan that reduces friction is most sustainable. Aligning with the planned numeric cue (~3) by offering three simple actions supports hydration, mindful eating, and flexible logging, which is helpful for BED management and social situations.",
    "user_utterance": "I appreciate the plan. Hydration is a no-brainer, so I'll start by drinking a glass now and keep a bottle within reach. The 2-minute pre-eating pause sounds helpful, but I might do a shorter check-in (about 1 minute) when I’m with friends or pressed for time, and gradually build up. If cravings come up, I’ll opt for hydrating, low-calorie options like watermelon or cucumber. Logging immediately feels tough, so I’ll try quick after-meal voice notes or a simple end-of-day reflection instead of a full log. I’m going to try this today and see how it feels, and tell you what worked or didn’t."

    "user_utterance": "That plan feels doable, thanks. I’ll start with a glass of water now and keep a bottle nearby. The 1‑minute pre‑meal pause is okay; I’ll try to keep it even shorter (about 30 seconds) when I’m with friends and gradually extend as I feel more comfortable. For cravings, I’ll reach for hydrating, low‑calorie options like watermelon or cucumber, or a warm herbal tea. I like the quick post‑meal voice note or end‑of‑day reflection and will keep them brief so they’re easy to stick with. If I notice patterns or triggers, I’ll note them and adjust. If I slip, I’ll be kind to myself and look for what I can learn from it. Could we add a simple urge‑surfing checklist (pause, breathe, reassess hunger, choose a small, low‑judgment option, hydrate) to guide me when cravings hit? I’ll try this today and report back on what felt easy, what was hard, and what I’d adjust for tomorrow."
