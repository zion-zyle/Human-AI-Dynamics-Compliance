With the heat and your plan to test mood-based steps, start with this quick, doable routine: 1) Hydrate now with 1 cup of water. 2) If cravings arise, try a 2-minute box-breathing cycle (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4). 3) If craving intensity is 3–5, pause for 3 minutes to observe the urge (no eating) and then choose a simple coping action (sip water, stretch, or take a brief indoor walk). 4) Log the moment: craving level, trigger, and what you did. 5) If the full 10-minute pause feels too long today, start with the 3-minute pause and save the longer version for tonight if you feel ready. Stay cool and hydrated.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought in detail, but here's a concise rationale: the morning is hot (32°C) in Suwon, which can increase dehydration and sensitivity to cravings. A small, ultra-implementable plan reduces decision fatigue and lets you trial the mood-based pause without feeling overwhelmed. The context suggests starting with a quick hydration and a short grounding routine, with an option to scale up to the longer pause later if you’re comfortable.",
    "user_utterance": "I’m glad you’re keeping things simple. Today external cues feel a bit louder for me, so I want something tiny and doable. The hydration plus a short breathing cycle sounded doable, but I’m worried I’ll skip the longer pause when urges spike. Can we keep it ultra-light today—like 2 minutes of box-breathing and a 2-minute urge-observation—then log what happened? I want to build consistency one small step at a time. And if I binge anyway, what would be a practical, non-judgmental plan for tonight to start fresh?"

Hydration helps in the heat, so keep a glass of water nearby. \n\nIf you binge tonight: start with a non-judgmental acknowledgment (e.g., “This happened.”). Then do a lightweight reset: drink water, have a small protein-containing snack if comfortable, and do a brief 5-minute stretch or walk.
