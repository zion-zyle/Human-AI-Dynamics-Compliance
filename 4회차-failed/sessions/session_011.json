It’s a hot Suwon morning (32°C), so let’s keep this simple and grounding: 1) drink 500 ml of cool water now, 2) if you feel ravenous within the next 30 minutes, choose a small snack around 100–180 kcal (for example, Greek yogurt with berries or an apple with a teaspoon of peanut butter), 3) try a quick grounding move: 4-4-4 breathing for 60 seconds or a 5-minute slow walk if you can, 4) log your urge level and what you ate.

    "user_utterance": "Thanks for the concrete plan. I’ll try it: start with 500 ml of water now, and if cravings pop up in the next 30 minutes I’ll aim for a small 100–180 kcal snack (like yogurt with berries).

I know my consistency fluctuates, so I’ll set a 30-minute check-in and aim for steady follow-through.

Here’s an updated, compact plan to handle persistent cravings:\n\n- When cravings arise within the next 30 minutes, start a 10-minute pre-craving delay before deciding.\n- During the 10-minute delay: perform 60 seconds of 4-4-4 breathing, then use a grounding cue (name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear).\n- Reach out for support before deciding. Send a quick message to a trusted person (sample text below).\n- After the 10-minute pause, re-check your urge on a 0–10 scale. If still ≥6, go ahead with a small snack in the 100–180 kcal range and log it.
